<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE printed version of the earliest
extant English Faust Book that has been modernized for the present
edition is the reprint by H. Logeman in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Recueil de Travaux de
l’Université de Gand</i> [24<sup>e</sup> fascicule. Gand, 1900]. This
is the only reprint of the unique copy of the English Faust Book of
1592, which is in the British Museum, and with which I was able to
compare it.</p>

<p>The first edition of the English Wagner Book has likewise only
been reprinted once, after one of the two copies in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford, by Alfred E. Richards in <cite>Literarhistorische
Forschungen</cite> [XXXV. Heft. Berlin, 1907], and this edition I have
used for the present modernization.</p>

<p>Those who wish to read the Faust and Wagner Books in the old
orthography, I would refer to the careful editions of these two
scholars. I have only modernized the old spellings and occasionally,
for the sake of clarity, the punctuation, but have made no syntactical
alterations whatever. Even where, in the case of the Wagner Book, the
syntax sometimes obscured the meaning, I have thought it best to let it
stand.</p>

<p>The versions printed by Thoms in his <cite>Early

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xvi]</span>

English Prose Romances</cite> are later than those printed
in this volume. His Faust Book is undated, but the
British Museum Catalogue gives it the suppositional
date 1700. His Wagner Book reproduces the text of
1680. His introduction is, of course, out of date and
practically useless.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE story of the man who sells his
soul to the powers of evil in return for material gain, is one of
the most ancient in the history of humanity. It is perhaps as old as
humanity, for when the light of self-consciousness first began to dawn
on man, he no doubt desired to know more than his limited intellect
could tell him, or to possess something that the world could not or
would not give him. When he looked around, and was frightened at his
own littleness, he created gods for his protection, and these gods he
endeavoured to propitiate, until they became his tyrants. They were
the symbols of his hopes and fears, so that when he was propitiating
his gods he was stereotyping the limitations of his own mind. And the
most important of those limitations was that he must not look beyond
his manufactured gods for the hidden causes of things. A profound
instinct nevertheless urged him to probe beyond, and the resulting
spiritual unrest, which has always manifested itself spasmodically in
the human race, underwent various personifications at different times.
The elements of the Faust story were already present in the Garden of
Eden—the Tree of Knowledge, the personification of Evil in the Serpent,
and the Woman who was tempted to overstep the bounds of what was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>

permitted by the orthodox authority, in order to grasp the Forbidden
Fruit. It is significant for the peculiar construction of the human
mind, that it was always the Spirit of Evil which led the way to
spiritual emancipation. In order to give concrete expression to his
almost unconscious thirst for greater knowledge, man had to pretend
to himself that this craving was pernicious. His very attempts to
free himself from superstition provide the strongest evidence of
the tortuous way in which his mind had to work, for it could only
rise to a higher conception of its own worth by playing a game of
self-deception.</p>

<p>The Faust problem was not peculiar to the Christian era. The Jews
had their Solomon and the Greeks their Prometheus, but it was only at
the end of the Middle Ages, when the old world was in the melting-pot,
that there arose the most famous of all these legends, the most curious
element in which is perhaps the fact that there was at the source of it
an actual person.</p>

<h3 id="HISTORICAL_PERSONAGE">I</h3>
</div>

<div class="center large"><i>The Historical Personage</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first record of an actual magician or adventurer
of the name of Faust occurs in a letter written in Latin
by the Abbot Trithemius of Würzburg, formerly of
the Benedictine monastery of Sponheim, near Kreuznach
in the Palatinate, to the mathematician and
Court astrologer, Johann Virdung, on the 20th of
August, 1507. The learned abbot, whose name is
the Latinized form of Johannes Tritheim, writes to
his friend in Heidelberg to warn him against a certain
Faust from whom the astrologer is expecting a visit:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“That man, about whom you have written to me,
Georgius Sabellicus, who has ventured to call himself
the prince of necromancers is a vagabond, an empty
babbler and a knave: worthy to be whipped, that he
might no longer profess publicly abominable matters
which are opposed to the holy Church. For what are
the titles which he assumes, other than the signs of
a most stupid and senseless mind, which proves that
he is a fool and no philosopher? Thus he has adopted
the following title: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Magister Georgius Sabellicus</i>,
<i>Faustus junior</i>, fountain of necromancers, astrologer,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">magus secundus</i>, chiromancer, aëromancer, pyromancer,
second in hydromancy. Behold the foolish temerity
of the man; what madness is necessary to call oneself

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>

the fountain of necromancy. A man who is, in truth,
entirely devoid of education, should rather call himself
a fool than a <i>magister</i>. But his wickedness is not unknown
to me. When some years ago I was returning
from the March of Brandenburg, I met this man in
the town of Gelnhausen, where I was told in the inn
of many frivolous things promised by him with great
audacity. When he heard of my presence, he fled
forthwith from the inn and could not be persuaded
by anyone to present himself to me.</p>

<p>He sent to me also by a citizen the advertisement
of his foolishness, which I remember he sent to you.
In that town I was told by priests, that he had said in
the presence of many people that he had attained such
great knowledge and memory of all wisdom, that if
all the works of Plato and Aristotle, together with all
their philosophy, had been absolutely wiped out of
human memory, he would restore them, like a second
Hebrew Ezra, by his genius, totally and more excellently
than before.</p>

<p>When I was later on in Speyer, he came to Würzburg,
and is said to have boasted with similar conceit
in the presence of many people, that the miracles of
our Redeemer Christ are no cause for astonishment;
he himself could do everything that Christ had done,
as often as and whenever he wished. This year, during
the last days of Lent, he came to Kreuznach, where he
made vast promises in a similar swaggering manner,
and said that in alchemy he was the most perfect of
any that had ever lived, and knew and could perform
whatever the people wished. During this time the
office of schoolmaster in this town was vacant, and it

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>

was conferred upon him through the intercession of
Franz von Sickingen, the steward of your prince, a
man who is exceedingly ardent with regard to mystical
matters. But soon afterwards he began to practise a
most infamous kind of fornication, forsooth, with the
boys, and he fled, when the matter came to light,
from his imminent punishment.</p>

<p>This is what is evident to me, according to the most
certain testimony, concerning that man whose visit
you are awaiting with such eagerness.”</p>
</div>

<p>The accusations of the abbot are to be taken with
a pinch of salt, for he was himself suspected of dabbling
in magic, and his indignation may have been coloured
by more than a tinge of jealousy. He is known to
have declaimed before the Emperor Maximilian
against the followers of the black art, and there is
a letter, written by him only four days before the
above epistle to Virdung, in which he protests against
the imputing to him of magic practices. He was even
rumoured to have conjured up the spirits of the dead in
the presence of the Emperor. At any rate, he does
not seem to have been anxious for popular inclusion
among the necromancers. Neither is it at all certain
that there is any truth in the scandal about the school
at Kreuznach, for that was the sort of vice which it
was usual to attribute to dissolute magicians.</p>

<p>It cannot be explained why Faust should have
called himself <i>junior</i>, for there is no trace of any earlier
magician of the same name. Whether <i>Sabellicus</i> was
his real name, and <i>Faustus junior</i> a kind of professional
title, or whether George Faust attached the title

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>

<i>Sabellicus</i> to his name as an allusion to the magic art
of the Sabines, is likewise a mystery. It will be
noticed that he is called <i>George</i>, and the same Christian
name occurs again, six years later, in the second
existing reference to Faust.</p>

<p>Conrad Mutianus Rufus (Conrad Mut, Canon at
Gotha, called Rufus on account of his red hair), a
friend of Reuchlin and Melanchthon, and one of the
most cultured of the Humanists, makes the following
statement in a letter written from Erfurt to his friend
Heinrich Urbanus on the 7th of October, 1513:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“There came a week ago to Erfurt a certain chiromancer
named Georgius Faustus, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Helmitheus Hedebergensis</i>,
a mere braggart and fool. The professions of
this man and of all the fortune-tellers are vain. The
rude people marvel at him, the priests should denounce
him. I heard him swaggering at the inn. I did not
reprove his boastfulness, for why should I bother
about the foolishness of others?”</p>
</div>

<p>These two George Fausts are obviously the same
person. The term <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Helmitheus Hedebergensis</i> may be
meant for <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hemitheus Hedelbergensis</i>, half-god of
Heidelberg, where the charlatan perhaps pretended
to have studied.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There was a Bachelor named Johann
Faust, of Simmern, at Heidelberg in the year 1509,
but it is unlikely that he has any connection with our
Faust.</p>

<p>There is a legend that Faust was given asylum at
the monastery of Maulbronn by the Abbot Entenfuss

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>

in the year 1516, and that he there pursued his alchemistic
activities. The well-known “Faust tower”
which is still shown there was, however, not built
until nearly a hundred years later.</p>

<p>The next reference we find is an entry in the account
book of the Bishop of Bamberg by the latter’s chamberlain,
under the date 12th of February, 1520:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Item 10 gulden given and presented to Doctor
Faustus <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">philosophus</i> in honour of his having cast for
my gracious master a nativity or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">indicium</i>, paid on
Sunday after Scholastica by the order of Reverendissimus.”</p>
</div>

<p>A less flattering entry is that in the minutes of the
resolutions of the Town Council of Ingolstadt in
1528:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“To-day, Wednesday after St. Vitus, 1528. The
fortune-teller shall be ordered to leave the town and
spend his penny elsewhere.” This is supplemented
by another entry in the record of expulsions: “To-day,
Wednesday after St. Vitus, 1528, one who calls
himself Dr. Jörg Faustus of Heidelberg has been told
to spend his penny elsewhere, and has promised not
to resent or mock such summons of the authorities.”</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that the same Christian name
again occurs, in conjunction with the reference to
Heidelberg.</p>

<p>There is then a gap of some eleven years before we meet the name again
in the <cite>Index Sanitatis</cite> of the physician

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>

Philipp Begardi of Worms, published in 1539:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“There is also to be found a renowned and bold
man; I did not wish to have mentioned his name, but
it will not be hidden or unknown. For some years
ago he wandered through almost every province,
principality and kingdom, made his name known to
everybody, and boasted loudly of his great art, not
only in medicine, but also in chiromancy, necromancy,
physiognomy, crystal-gazing and more of such arts.
And not only boasted, but also gave himself out to
be and wrote himself as a famous and experienced
master. He also himself acknowledged and did not
deny, that he was, and was called Faust, and signed
himself <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Philosophus Philosophorum</i>, etc. There has,
however, been a great number of people, who have
complained to me, that they have been swindled
by him. His promises were as great as those
of Thessalus. Similarly his fame, like that of Theophrastus
also; but the fulfilment, as I learn, was found
to be very small and fraudulent; yet he was not slow
in taking money, and at his departure many people
were cheated. But what can one do about it, gone is
gone.”</p>
</div>

<p>When Philipp von Hutten, the cousin of the more
famous Ulrich von Hutten, was about to start on his
first expedition to Venezuela in 1534, Faust prophesied
that the voyage would be unfortunate, and he
was right, for von Hutten, in a description of the voyage
written in 1540, writes: “I must acknowledge that
the philosopher Faustus divined it correctly, for we

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>

have had a very bad year.” A rival fortune-teller,
Joachim Camerarius, who had declared that the voyage
would be lucky, asks in a letter to a friend, written in
1536, what Faust can prophesy about the German
Emperor’s next battle with the King of France.</p>

<p>Johann Gast, a protestant clergyman at Basle,
relates two anecdotes of Faust in the edition of his
<cite>Sermones Convivales</cite> which appeared in 1548:—</p>
<br>

<p class="center">“<i>Concerning the Necromancer Faust.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>He once turned into a very wealthy monastery, in
order to spend the night there. A brother sets before
him ordinary, weak, not very tasty wine. Faust asks
him for better wine from another barrel, which is
usually given to distinguished guests. The brother
says: ‘I haven’t the keys. The prior is asleep, and
I may not rouse him.’ Faust replies: ‘The keys lie
in that corner; take them and open that barrel on
the left and bring me a drink!’ The brother refuses
and declares that he has no permission from the prior
to give the guests other wine. When Faust hears this,
he says: ‘In a short time thou wilt experience strange
things, inhospitable brother!’ Early next morning
he went away full of bitterness, without taking leave,
and sent a raging devil into the monastery, who made
an uproar day and night, and set everything in motion
in the church and in the rooms of the monks, so that
they had no peace, whatever they did. At last they
consulted as to whether they should abandon the
monastery or totally destroy it. They therefore
announced their misfortune to the Count Palatine,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>

who took the monastery under his protection and sent
away the monks, to whom he allows every year what
they need, keeping the rest for himself. Some assert
that even now, when monks enter the monastery,
there arises such a tumult, that the inhabitants have
no peace. The devil knows how to manage that.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="center"><i>Another Instance of Faust.</i></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>When I was dining with him in the great College at
Basle, he gave the cook birds of various kinds, concerning
which I did not know where he had bought them or
who had given them to him, since at that time none
was being sold in Basle, and they were birds such as
I have never seen in our neighbourhood. He had with
him a dog and a horse, which, as I believe, were
devils, since they could do everything. Some people
told me that the dog had sometimes assumed the form
of a servant and brought him food. The wretched
man came to a terrible end; for the devil strangled
him; his corpse lay on the bier on its face all the time,
although it was turned round five times.”</p>
</div>

<p>The chronicler appears to have been a superstitious
person, and he is the first to refer to Faust as being in
league with the Devil, for Trithemius had looked upon
him as a dissolute, wandering scholar, and Begardi
thought him little more than a common charlatan.
None of the last three authorities quoted above has
mention of Faust’s Christian name, but he appears
as <i>Johannes</i> in a book compiled by Johannes Manlius
(Johann Mennel) in 1563, <cite>Locorum Communium Collectanea</cite>,
which consists mainly of reports of conversations

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>

with Melanchthon, to whom the following
reminiscence is also to be attributed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I knew a man named Faustus of Kundling, a
little town near my home. When he studied at Cracow,
he had learned Magic, which was formerly keenly
studied there and where public lectures were delivered
about this art. Later he wandered about in many
places and spoke about secret things. When he
wanted to create a sensation at Venice, he announced
that he was going to fly into the heavens. The devil
then lifted him up in the air, but let him fall to earth
again, so that he nearly gave up the ghost. A few
years ago, this Johannes Faustus sat very downcast
on his last day in a village in the duchy of Württemberg.
Mine host asked him why he was so downcast, this not
being his custom or habit; for he was usually a graceless
rogue, who led a dissolute life, so that at one time
and another his love affairs had nearly brought him
to his death. He thereupon replied to the host in
that village: ‘Do not be frightened to-night!’
At midnight the house was shaken. Since on the next
morning Faustus had not risen and it was already
noon, the host went into his room and found him
lying beside the bed with his face twisted round, as
the devil had killed him. During his life, he kept
a dog, which was the devil.... This Faustus
escaped from our town of Wittenberg, when the
excellent prince, duke Johann, had given the order
that he was to be arrested. In a similar way, he is said
to have escaped likewise in Nuremberg. At the
beginning of the meal, he felt warm; he immediately

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>

rose from the table and paid his scot to the host. He
was hardly outside the door when the minions came
and asked for him. This magician Faustus, an infamous
beast, a cesspool (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cloaca</i>) of many devils,
boasted that all the victories which had been won by
the imperial armies in Italy, had been obtained for
them by him through his magic, which was a most
shameless lie.”</p>
</div>

<p>This story is repeated by Andreas Hondorff in his
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Promptuarium Exemplorum</i>, which appealed five years
later, in 1568:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Such a necromancer was Johann Faustus, who
practised many tricks through his black art. He had
with him always a black dog, which was a devil.
When he came to Wittenberg he would have been
arrested by order of the Prince Elector, if he had
not escaped. The same would have happened to
him in Nuremberg also, where he likewise escaped.
But this was his reward. When his time was up, he
was in a tavern in a village of Württemberg. Upon
the host asking him why he was so downcast, he
replied, ‘Do not be afraid to-night, if you hear a great
banging and shaking of the house.’ In the morning
he was found lying dead in his room, with his neck
twisted round.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is a casual reference to Faust in the <i>Table-talk
of Martin Luther</i>, edited by Johannes Aurifaber
(Johann Goldschmidt) in 1566:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“But when in the evening, at table, mention was
made of a necromancer named Faustus, Doctor

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>

Martin says earnestly, ‘the devil does not employ the services of
magicians against me; had he been able to do me hurt, he would have
done it long ago. He has no doubt had me often by the head, but he
never-the-less had to let me go again.’”
</p>
</div>

<p>In a chronicle concluded in the same year by the
Count Froben Christoph von Zimmern, the scene of
Faust’s death is given as Staufen in Breisgau:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“But that the practice of such art (of soothsaying)
is not only godless, but extremely perilous, that is
undeniable, as is proved by experience, and we know
how it went with the famous necromancer Faustus.
He, after many wonderful things which he did during
his life, about which one could write a special treatise,
was at last, at an advanced age, slain by the evil spirit
in the province of Staufen in Breisgau.”</p>
</div>

<p>And there is further a reference to his revenge on
the inhospitable monks:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“About that time (i.e. after 1539), Faustus died at,
or at least not far from Staufen, the little town in
Breisgau. During his life, he was a strange necromancer,
who in our times could be found in German
provinces and had so many strange dealings, that he
will not easily be forgotten for many years. He lived
to be an old man, and, as is said, died wretchedly.
Many people have thought that he was killed by the
evil spirit, whom in his lifetime he only called his
brother-in-law (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Schwager</i>). The books which he left
behind have come into the possession of the lord of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>

Staufen, in whose province he died, and many people
have afterwards tried to obtain them, and in my
opinion desired in them a perilous and unlucky
treasure. He charmed a spirit into the monastery of
the monks of Lüxheim in Wasgau, which they could
not get rid of for many years, and which troubled
them strangely; for the sole reason that they had once
been unwilling to give him shelter for the night, that
was why he had procured for them this turbulent
visitor; at the same time, it is said, that a similar
spirit was attached to the former abbot of St. Diesenberg
by an envious wandering scholar.”</p>
</div>

<p>The last considerable reference, before the publication
of the folk-book, is in the edition of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Praestigiis
Daemonum</i> by Johannes Wierus (Johann Weyer, or
Wier), which appeared in 1568. A German edition
of this book was published eighteen years later.
Wierus was one of the most distinguished and enlightened
physicians of his time, and he fought for
years, at first with some success, against the fanatical
persecution of witches which was providing human
torches in every village in Germany. In this book on
the illusions of the devils, he protests against the witch-burnings,
and it is noticeable that he does not definitely
refer to Faust’s alleged compact with the Devil:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“When formerly at Cracow in Poland necromancy
was taught publicly, there came one of the name of
Johannes Faustus, of Kundling, who in a short time
understood this art so well, that a short time ago,
before the year 1540, he practised it to the amazement
of many and with many lies and frauds in Germany,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>

publicly and without fear. What a strange hoaxer
and adventurer he was, and what strange tricks he
was able to perform, I will here only demonstrate to
the reader by one instance, but with the instruction
that he promise me beforehand that he will not imitate
him. When on one occasion this necromancer
Faustus on account of his wicked tricks was imprisoned
at Battenburg, which lies on the River Maas
and borders on the Duchy of Geldern, in the absence
of the Count Hermann, the chaplain of that place,
Dr. Johann Dorsten, a pious, simple man, showed him
much kindness, because he had promised to teach
him many good arts and make him a profoundly
experienced man. Therefore, when he saw that Faust
was very fond of drink, he sent him wine so long till
the barrel was empty. But when the magician Faustus
noticed that, and the chaplain also prepared to go to
Graven to get a shave, he told him that if he would
procure for him more wine, he would teach him an
art, how to remove his beard without a razor or anything.
When the chaplain forthwith agreed, he bade
him take some arsenic and rub well his beard and chin
with it, not telling him to prepare it beforehand and
mix it with other things. When he did this, his chin
began to burn, so that not only the hair fell out, but
the skin and flesh came off as well.</p>

<p>I knew another man who had a black beard, and was
yellowish of face on account of his melancholy complexion.
When he visited the magician Faust, the
latter said to him: ‘Really, I thought you were my
brother-in-law, my sister’s husband; and so I looked
immediately at your feet, to see whether you had long,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>

crooked claws!’ Thus he compared the good man,
because he was swarthy, to the devil, and called him
also, as was always his custom, his brother-in-law.
But he received his reward at last. For, as is said,
he was found dead one morning beside his bed in
a village in Württemberg, his face turned towards his
back, and the previous night there was such a turmoil
in the house, that the whole house shook.”</p>
</div>

<p>And lastly, there is a reference to Faust’s conjuring
up the dead in Wolffgang Bütner’s <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Epitome Historiarum</i>,
in 1576:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I have heard that Faustus, at Wittenberg, showed
to the students and to an exalted man N——, Hector,
Ulysses, Hercules, Æneas, Samson, David and others,
who came forth with fierce bearing and earnest
countenance and disappeared again, and princely
personages are also said to have been present at the
time and to have looked on.”</p>
</div>

<p>At this point it will be well to summarize what we
have learnt about Faust from contemporary references.
The difficulty with regard to his Christian name has
already been mentioned. If his real name was <i>Georg</i>,
it may have been forgotten and replaced by the more
common one of <i>Johann</i>, or there may have been two
magicians of the name of Faust, the older one named
Georg and the later one Johann, who may have taken
the name of Faust because it had already been rendered
famous by his predecessor. The latter hypothesis is,
however, extremely unlikely, and there seems very
little reason to doubt that all the references are to the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>

same individual. It has been suggested that the name
Johann may have originated through confusion with
Johann Fust, the printer, but the latter died in the
year 1466, and it was only during the seventeenth
century that the Faust legend was attributed to him.
The earliest investigators thought that the whole
story was a mere legend, and possibly invented by the
monks as an expression of their hatred of the inventor
of printing, though as a matter of fact, it was only
through financial sharp practice that Fust obtained
possession of the printing outfit of the real inventor,
Gutenberg.</p>

<p>As early as 1683, however, a professor of theology
at Wittenberg brought forward evidence of the actual
existence of an individual of the name of Faust.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>According to Manlius-Melanchthon, Faust was
born in Knittlingen and studied at the University of
Cracow, though he appears later to have said he came
from Heidelberg. About the year 1505, the Abbot
Trithemius came in contact with him at Gelnhausen,
though he did not speak to him, and does not even
say that he actually saw him. He was later in Würzburg,
and in 1507 he came to Kreuznach where he obtained
a post as schoolmaster, though he was soon compelled
to flee on account of alleged immorality. In the year
1513, he was in Erfurt, where he called himself the
half-god of Heidelberg. He may have stayed at
Maulbronn during the year 1516, but we hear nothing
definite until he casts the horoscope of the Bishop of
Bamberg in 1520. Eight years later, he was expelled

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>

from Ingolstadt, and six years after we find
Philipp von Hutten seeking his advice about a forthcoming
expedition. Another five years elapse, and a physician
of Worms refers to the complaints of people who had
been swindled by him; the remark “gone is gone”
may allude to the disappearance or death of Faust,
though it is more likely that it refers to the money
of the victims. The Zimmern Chronicle mentions
the village of Staufen, near Freiburg in Breisgau, as
the scene of his death, and gives the date as some time
after 1539. Wierus places the period of his activity
before 1540, and when Gast writes in 1548, he refers
to Faust as being already dead. He appears to have
travelled extensively, for there are additional allusions
to his presence in Wittenberg, Nuremberg, Battenburg
on the Maas, and Basle, where Gast met him.</p>

<p>There seems no doubt that Doctor Faust surpassed
all the wandering scholars of his time both in pretensions
and notoriety. His attempts to fly and to conjure
up spirits, to say nothing of the boast that he could
restore lost manuscripts of classical authors, are all
intelligent anticipations of what has been done or
pretended in the present century. He was rather
indiscreet in declaring that he had helped the Imperial
armies to victory in Italy, but he may have been emboldened
by patronage such as that of Philipp von
Hutten and the Bishop of Bamberg, though the
distinguished humanists and reformers would have
nothing to do with the braggart. The students appear
to have been greatly impressed by him and he certainly
imposed on the uneducated people.</p>

<p>Soon after his death the historical facts become

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>

blurred, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding
his disappearance may have given an additional
impulse to the subsequent legend, which appears,
indeed, to have started even during his lifetime.
The later contemporary references are already coloured
with imaginative detail, and anecdotes relating to his
various pranks, real or alleged, were circulating among
all classes of the people. These soon became the
nucleus of a large collection of stories, some of which
had formerly been related of other magicians and were
now fathered on Faust, until in the year 1587, scarcely
fifty years after his death, the first printed account of
the life of “Dr. Johann Faust, the notorious Magician
and Necromancer” was published, as a warning to all
readers, at Frankfort-on-the-Main. It is astonishing
that he should so soon have become a myth, but an
explanation may perhaps be sought in the ferment
and unrest of an age which stands between the
medieval and the modern, when old conceptions were
tumbling and new worlds, both material and intellectual,
were being discovered. Literature was no longer
a diversion for the upper classes, and the dreams and
traditions of the people were finding their way into
print. Till Owlglass, the Wandering Jew, Doctor
Faust are all types in which have been concentrated
the lore and myth of centuries. In these representative
figures, the people have focussed their longings
and their aversions, their hopes and fears, and none of
the wizards of popular superstition was more familiar
to them than the man who had put forth his pretensions
in all the market-places of Germany.</p>

<p>The Zimmern Chronicle declares that when Faust

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>

died, he left behind him various books which came
into the possession of the lord of Staufen, and that
many people had endeavoured to obtain these works.
Whether there is any truth in this statement is a matter
for considerable doubt, but the booksellers were not
long in turning the belief to their own advantage
and supplying the demand for books of an occult
nature. There were at first manuscripts in circulation,
which gave instructions how to practise the various
magic arts attributed to Faust, the most famous of
them being the <cite>Höllenzwang</cite>, or <cite>Conquest of Hell</cite>.
They were usually disposed of secretly by disreputable
people at exorbitant prices,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but later the publishers
brought out volumes which they ascribed to the
authorship of Faust, and some of these were even
supplied with false dates, to give them an appearance
of antiquity.</p>

<p>One such manuscript bears the following title:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Secret and hidden, highly-authenticated Magic
Writings, for the advantage of all, which have been
truly tested by me, Doctor Johann Faust, and found
trustworthy in each and every case, to the purpose
that I have set down herein honestly and without
falseness or deceit the principles of all the arts of the
world, how I have practised them all myself and come
thereby to great fortune; likewise I have presented
openly everything which I have herein recounted to
my successors, necromantic as well as cabalistic, that
I may be well remembered; all Spirits have been

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>

subject to me through these my Writings, they have
been compelled to fetch for me and do all my bidding.
Nothing further have I written but these twelve parts.
Let him who finds and obtains them use them with
caution and take strict heed of all therein, that you
may not endanger body and life, against which I warn
you in all sincerity.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not long before a publisher saw the business
possibilities of the legend, for in the autumn of the
year 1587 there appeared at Frankfort-on-the-Main the
first printed account of the life and death of Faust:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The story is preceded by a dedication to two friends
of the publisher, and a <i>Preface to the Christian Reader</i>,
in the former of which there is reference to the widespread
popularity of the legend: “Since many years
ago there was great and universal talk in Germany
about the various adventures of Doct. Johannes
Faustus, the notorious magician and necromancer,
and everywhere there is a great demand for the history
of the said Faustus at entertainments and gatherings,
and since likewise there is now and then mention in
the works of some modern historians of this magician,
his devilish arts and fearful end, it has often been a
matter of astonishment to me that nobody has composed
a regular account of this fearful story and
published it as a warning to the whole of Christendom.
I have also not hesitated to enquire from scholars and
wise people whether this history has perhaps already
been written down by anyone, but I have never been
able to discover anything certain, until recently it
was communicated and sent to me by a good friend
in Speyer, with the request that I should publish and
present it as a fearful example of devilish deceit,
murder of body and soul, as a warning to all Christians.”
This dedication is dated Monday, the 4th of September,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>

1587, and signed by Johann Spies himself. The
Preface to the Christian Reader, amid much quoting
of the Bible, declares that, “The exorcisers of the devil
seldom come to a good end, as is to be seen in the case
of Dr. Johann Faustus, who was alive within the memory
of man, signed a compact and league with the devil,
experienced many strange adventures and practised
abominable infamy and vice, with guzzling, swilling,
fornication and all kinds of sensual pleasure, until
at last the devil gave him his deserved reward and
wrung his neck in a dreadful manner.”</p>

<p>This little volume must have been enormously
popular, for although it appeared so late in the season,
there were before the end of the year at least four
reprints, a new original edition, and a further edition
containing eight new chapters. The <i>editio princeps</i>
(of which there is a copy in the British Museum)
contains 69 chapters.</p>

<p>It is not long since an older version of the <i>Historia</i>
in manuscript, dating from the seventies or early
eighties of the sixteenth century, was discovered.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It contains a different preface and two more chapters,
one of which describes how Faust releases a nobleman
and old schoolfellow named von Reuttpüffel from
captivity in Turkey, and brings him home just after
his wife has married again. The story is told with all

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>

the hearty bawdiness of the time, and the wife is made
to feel thankful that her vigorous first husband has
returned to her, after her single, disappointing experience
with the second one. There are in addition
a few prophecies made by Faust in his last year
concerning the Papacy, including one concerning the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572. It was written,
of course, after the event. The preface states that
the manuscript was translated from the Latin, but
whether the first version of the Faust book was really
written in any other language than German it is
impossible to say.</p>

<p>It is already obvious from the Preface to the Faust
book that the publication of the wicked life and
dreadful doom of Faust was intended as a warning to
all who could not find peace and content in the bosom
of the Church, but would seek to explore beyond,
with the treacherous aid of science, which at that time,
of course, included magic. Curiosity in theological
matters was regarded as an unhealthy symptom, and
was only playing into the hands of the Devil, who,
in the words of the Epistle of Peter, quoted in the
Preface, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom
he may devour. Faust represents the spirit of enquiry,
which was regarded as fatal to the soul, but nobody
seems to have wondered whether a soul that had to be
so jealously guarded and could be so easily lost was
worth having at all. The strong Lutheran tendency
which was a characteristic of the activities of Spies
as a publisher, is also a marked feature of the Faust
book. Martin Luther himself shared the prevailing
view of the time, that the world is divided into two

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>

camps, that of God and that of the Devil, and the
latter is mentioned frequently in his writings. Faust
can, with some reservation, be looked upon as the
great counterpart of Luther; they are the two poles
of the sixteenth century. In the book, the contrast
is all the more striking since it does not appear as an
intentional element in the work. The views of Luther
are not definitely defended, but are taken as a matter
of course, and the contrast between the theologian
and the sceptic develops naturally from the theme,
though the Lutheran doctrine occasionally comes
prominently to the fore. Both the Faust of the legend
and Luther were Doctors of Theology and closely
connected with Wittenberg, the cradle of the Reformation.
Starting from the same point, they reached
goals which were diametrically opposed. They both
lectured on the culture of antiquity, and they had both
been in Rome, but whereas Luther had set out with
feelings of reverence, only to return in disappointment
and indignation, Faust was merely amused and contemplated
with cynical complacency the license of the
Vatican, where the priests were no better than himself.
Luther married in accordance with the tenets of the
Church, but Faust rejected the sacrament of marriage
for the pagan Helena. Luther based his faith on the
Bible, Faust was not content to accept the Holy Writ,
but sought to penetrate the forbidden mysteries
beyond it. Faust entered into league with the Devil,
while Luther hurled his inkstand at him.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It is true that it was not in the spirit of Luther to
conceive of the defection from orthodox theology as

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>

defection from God, and the ridicule to which the
Church of Rome and its priests are exposed in the
Faust book, even the Devil himself appearing in the
guise of a monk, would quite possibly even have
appealed to his robust sense of humour. Nevertheless,
there seems little reason to doubt that the book
was written from the Lutheran standpoint. Since,
however, in the field of German literary research, it
seems impossible for any definite point of view, with
whatever weight of proof it may be supported, to be
maintained for very long, before a scholar brings
forward its exact opposite, which he defends with
equally weighty evidence, there has recently been an
attempt to prove that the tendency of the Faust book
was not Lutheran but Catholic.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The author of this
theory does not deny that the intention of some
passages is obviously hostile to Catholicism, but he
declares that they are later interpolations, and endeavours
to prove that the book is a parody on Luther,
who is represented as a modern Bacchus and companion
of the Devil. The first direct anti-clerical reference is
the taunt at the celibacy of the clergy in Faust’s
conversation with Mephostophiles concerning the
former’s desire to take a wife. The Devil endeavours
to dissuade him by declaring that marriage is a divine
institution, but Faust retorts that the monks and nuns
do not marry. This passage is lacking in the Wolfenbüttel
MS. In the chapter which deals with the
journey through Europe, Faust remarks at Cologne
that the Devil is in the Church of St. Ursula with the
11,000 virgins. The MS. has <i>Tempel</i> instead of <i>Teufel</i>.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>

When Faust arrives in Rome, he spends three days
and nights invisible in the pope’s palace, finding that
“these pigs at Rome are fattened and all ready to
roast and cook,” and after his experience in the harem
at Constantinople, he mounts up in the air in the vestments
of a pope. These last two adventures are also
to be found in the MS., but Dr. Wolff declares them
to be interpolations. His evidence, however, is not
convincing, and there is little reason to assume that
the spirit of any literary version of the Faust book
which may have been extant before 1587 was
different from the tendency of the edition published
by Spies.</p>

<p>The development from historical fact to legend
was influenced considerably by contact with other
myths of the same type. There were numerous alleged
covenanters with the Devil in the Middle Ages, of
whom the most akin to Faust was Theophilus of
Adana. But Theophilus was saved eventually from
eternal damnation by the intervention of the Virgin
Mary, and if the Faust book had really been of
Catholic origin, there is little doubt that the Madonna
and the Saints would have saved him. The fires of
Hell are essential to the spirit of the Faust book;
the pact is irrevocable. Many features formerly
attributed to other wizards were transferred to Faust,
including the Devil in the form of a black dog which
always accompanied Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim,
the enchanted garden conjured up by Albertus Magnus
for the Emperor in the midst of winter, and the exorcising
of the spirit of Alexander the Great and other
Greek heroes by the Abbot Trithemius. The incident

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>

of Helena may be due to the connection with Simon
Magus, who was accompanied on his journeys by a
courtesan named Helen. The fame of all these magicians
sank into obscurity, and the one figure that carried
on into future centuries the memory of their deeds
was Faust.</p>

<p>When the oral legend was cast into literary form,
the anonymous author appears to have consulted
many works of reference. The long chapter which
describes the journey of Faust and Mephostophiles,
as well as the description of Paradise, is based on the
<i>Book of Chronicles</i> of Hartmann Schedel, which appeared
in 1493. The peculiar zig-zag nature of the
journey is due to the fact that Schedel gives the towns
in chronological order, according to the supposed year
in which they were founded, and the author of the
Faust book has copied them mechanically. Similarly
he has taken from the German-Latin dictionary
of the Swiss humanist Dasypodius, in alphabetical
order, the list of fish, game and wine with which Faust
entertains his guests at the court of the Count (really
Prince) of Anhalt. For example, the fish are mentioned
in the following order: <i>Aal</i>, <i>Barben</i>, <i>Bersing</i>, <i>Bickling</i>,
<i>Bolchen</i>, <i>Aschen</i>, <i>Forell</i>, <i>Hecht</i>, <i>Karpffen</i>, <i>Krebs</i>,
<i>Moschel</i>, <i>Neunaugen</i>, <i>Platteissen</i>, <i>Salmen</i> and <i>Schleyen</i>,
and the wines are <i>Burgunder</i>, <i>Brabänder</i>, <i>Coblentzer</i>,
<i>Crabatischer</i>, <i>Elsässer</i>, <i>Engelländer</i>, <i>Frantzösische</i>,
<i>Rheinische</i>, <i>Spanische</i>, etc. The conversations concerning
the physical sciences and celestial phenomena
can be traced to <i>Elucidarius</i>, a collection of scientific
dialogues.</p>

<p>Augustin Lercheimer’s (pseudonym for Professor

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>

Hermann Witekind of Heidelberg) <i>Christliche Bedenken
und Erinnerung von Zauberei</i>, which first appeared
in 1585, was formerly thought to have been a direct
source of the Faust book, but it is possible that
Lercheimer himself borrowed from an earlier manuscript
of the Faust book. He anticipates modern
science when He protests against the witch-burnings,
and declares that witches should be sent to the physician
rather than to the judge. In the third edition of
his book, which was published in 1597, Lercheimer
denounces the Faust book as a libel on the University
and Church of Wittenberg:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It is all malicious lies.... He had neither house
nor yard at Wittenberg or elsewhere, was never at
home, lived like a vagabond, was a parasite, guzzled,
swilled and lived by his conjuring. How could he
have a house and yard by the outer gate of the town
in the Scheergasse, since there never was a suburb and
therefore no outer gate? Neither was there ever a
Scheergasse there. That in such a University, a man
whom Melanchthon used to call a cesspool of many
devils should have been made Master, to say nothing
of Doctor of Theology, which would be an eternal
disgrace to the degree and honourable title, who
believes that?... About all the other vanity, lies
and <i>Teufelsdreck</i> in the book, I will say nothing....
It is, to be sure, nothing new and no cause for surprise
that such calumnies are issued by the enemies of our
religion, but it is unwarrantable and lamentable that
our printers also should publish such books without
shame, whereby honest people are slandered and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>

inquisitive youths led to attempt similar magic feats;
to say nothing of the abuse of the beautiful and noble
art of printing, which has been conferred on us by
God.”</p>
</div>

<p>The fact that Lercheimer, who was an ardent
adherent of Luther, should have condemned the book
in such terms, cannot be regarded as evidence of its
anti-Lutheran tendency.</p>

<p>Another important manuscript was discovered
recently in Nuremberg.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> A certain Christoph Rosshirt,
a teacher of Nuremberg, who had studied in
Wittenberg, copied into an album about the year
1575, amidst other matter, anecdotes relating to
various magicians, including Doctor Faust. It will
be noticed that Faust’s Christian name is given here
as <i>George</i>. The Faust stories are four in number:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. When Dr. Georgius Faustus is lecturing to the
students at the University of Ingolstadt on philosophy
and necromancy, he invites some friends to dinner,
and tells them that the food and drink they are enjoying
come from the wedding-feast of the King of England.
He instructs them to hold on to the edge of the towel
when water is brought for them to wash their hands,
and he will take them to the dance at the King’s wedding.
When they are discovered in the ball-room,
they are taken for spies and arrested. They are condemned
to be hanged, but Faust rescues them in the
same way that he had brought them there. They
wash their hands in England and dry them in
Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>2. Faust asks a Jewish merchant at the Frankfort
Fair to change him some French money into good
talers. The merchant promises to call on Faust at
his inn and bring him the money, but when he arrives,
Faust is lying on a couch, apparently asleep. The Jew
puts his bag of talers on the table and shakes Faust
by the arm, but cannot rouse him; he becomes
annoyed and shakes him violently by the leg, which
comes off in his hand. He rushes in terror from the
house, leaving behind him cloak and money-bag
which are shared by Faust and his servant.</p>

<p>3. Faust sells a swineherd in Bamberg some fat
pigs, but warns him against driving them into flowing
water. On the next day the swineherd neglects the
warning and the pigs are turned into bundles of
straw. By this time Faust is well on the way to
Nuremberg.</p>

<p>4. On the evening before he is due to fulfil his pact
with the Devil, Faust arrives at a village inn and asks
for a room for the night. In the tap-room there is a
crowd of drunken, noisy peasants, who refuse to be
quiet when Faust asks them. The magician bewitches
them so that they remain sitting with their mouths
wide open, and he is able to have his last meal in peace.
He pays his bill, tips all the servants, and goes to bed,
but is persuaded by the host to disenchant the drunken
clowns. On the next morning, Faust is found dead
in bed.</p>
</div>

<p>As some of these stories had already been in circulation
about other magicians, it is obvious that Faust
was already becoming in popular imagination the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>

prototype, and it is possible to see the myth in progress
of development. The magician who sold his soul to
the Devil was not a new factor in the superstitious
fantasy of the people, but it was convenient to father
all the floating rumours on some outstanding personality
of whom everybody had heard and who had, in
the memory of many, boasted in public of his wicked
art. It is of interest to note that whereas Bütner
declares that it was at Wittenberg, the leading Lutheran
University, that Faust conjured up the Greek heroes,
this Nuremberg manuscript transfers his teaching
activities in philosophy and necromancy to the centre
of Catholic doctrine, Ingolstadt. Later on the scene
is shifted to Erfurt, the seat of humanism.</p>

<p>The enlarged edition which appeared in 1587,
with a different sequence of chapters and eight new
ones added, has drawn for its new matter mainly on
the <i>De Praestigiis Daemonum</i> of Wierus and the
<i>Christliche Bedenken und Erinnerung von Zauberei</i> of
Augustin Lercheimer, where the anecdotes are related
for the most part about other magicians. The title-page
of this edition states that it was printed by Spies,
but his printer’s ornament is lacking, so the statement
is most probably false.</p>

<p>The stories are as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Faust meets a peasant who has lost his horse, and
tells him that he has just seen a man riding away on it.
The peasant hurries after the supposed thief and there
is a gory fight, until he notices that the other man’s
horse is a stallion, whereas his own was a gelding.</p>

<p>2. Faust meets a priest in Cologne hastening to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>

church with his breviary in his hand, and turns the
sacred book into a pack of cards.</p>

<p>3. Faust enters an inn, where he is refused entertainment,
as there is no food in the house. He taps
the window with his finger, and says “Bring what
you have”; then putting his hand outside the window,
he draws in a large dish full of boiled pike and a large
can of good Rhine wine.</p>

<p>4. A castle in which Faust is living is besieged by
the Spanish troops of the Emperor Charles. He shoots
fragments from a tree under which a Spanish colonel
is sitting, although the latter is not visible from the
castle, and catches the Spanish cannon-balls in his
hands.</p>

<p>5. Faust swallows a servant in an inn, because he
fills the glasses too full, and washes the morsel down
with a bucket of water. The servant is afterwards
discovered in the yard all wet and dripping.</p>

<p>6. Faust cuts off a man’s head in an inn, but is
prevented from setting it on again by the mysterious
influence of one of the spectators; so he causes a lily
to grow on the table, from which he slices off the head,
and immediately one of the spectators falls decapitated
from his seat. Faust then sets the first man’s head
on his shoulders again.</p>

<p>7. Faust invites some gentlemen to dinner, but when
they arrive they find the table empty. Their host
bids his spirit fetch food from a neighbouring wedding-party,
and after the feast the guests ask him to show
them one of his tricks. He causes a vine to grow on
the table, with grapes for each of his guests, and tells

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>

each one to pick his own fruit with one hand and put
his knife to the stalk with the other, but to be very
careful not to cut. He then leaves the room, and when
he returns they are all grasping their own noses with
one hand and holding their knives in dangerous
proximity with the other.</p>

<p>8. Faust teaches a chaplain how to remove his beard
with arsenic.</p>
</div>

<p>The edition of 1589 is important, because it contains
the six extra “Erfurt Chapters,” which were most
probably based on local tradition in that town. Faust
is seen here as a lecturer at the University. The following
is a summary of these extra chapters:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="figcenter" id="ILLUS_P036">
  <img class="width45" src="images/i_p036.png" width="600" height="354" alt="Illustration: Faust sits astride the barrel.">
</div>

<p>1. Some students invite Faust to accompany them
to the Leipzig Fair, and after they have inspected
the town and the University they come to a wine-cellar,
where some draymen are endeavouring without
success to roll out a huge barrel. Faust mocks their
efforts, and they return his jeers with interest, but the
owner of the barrel offers to make a present of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>

contents to whoever can lift it out. Faust goes into
the cellar, sits astride the barrel as though it were a
horse and rides out. The host has to keep his
promise, and Faust shares the contents with his
companions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="ILLUS_P037">
  <img class="width45" src="images/i_p037.png" width="600" height="353" alt="Illustration: The one-eyed giant Polyphemus.">
</div>

<p>2. Faust was for some years at Erfurt and lectured
at the University. On one occasion, when he is lecturing
on Homer, the students request him to conjure up
the ancient heroes of Greece. He promises to do so
at his next lecture, which is consequently very fully
attended. The heroes duly appear in their armour—Menelaus,
Achilles, Hector, Priam, Alexander, Ulysses,
Ajax, Agamemnon and others, followed by the one-eyed
giant Polyphemus, with the extremities of a man
he is eating still projecting from between his teeth.
The spectators are terrified, but Faust laughs and
orders the spirits to go away again, which they all do
with the exception of Polyphemus, who looks as though
he would like to devour one or two of the students.
However, he also is persuaded to retire, but the students
do not ask Faust to repeat the experiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>3. Faust offers to bring to light the lost comedies
of Terence and Plautus, though only for a sufficient
length of time to enable them to be copied. The
theologians and members of the University council,
however, think that there are enough books in existence
from which the students can learn Latin, and in any
case there is the possibility of the Devil inserting in
the newly discovered works all kinds of poison and
bad examples, and the disadvantage might outbalance
the gain. So Faust is not given the opportunity this
time of proving his skill.</p>

<p>4. While Faust is in Prague, a friend of his, who is
giving a party in Erfurt, desires his presence, and presently
there is a knock at the door and Faust is seen to
have just alighted from his horse. He says he cannot
stay long as he must be back in Prague on the morrow.
He gets intoxicated, and asks the guests whether they
would not like to try some foreign wines. He thereupon
bores four holes in the table and puts plugs into
them. Glasses are fetched, Faust draws the plugs
and serves each man with the wine he desires. It
appears that his horse, who is devouring all the oats
in the stable and looking for more, is really Mephostophiles.
Early in the morning Faust rides away, and
the guests who accompany him to the door see his
horse rise with him into the air.</p>

<p>5. Faust invites some friends to his lodging, and
when they arrive there is neither food nor drink,
fire nor smoke. Their host raps on the table with his
knife, and a servant comes in. Faust asks, “How
swift are you?” and the reply is, “Like an arrow.”

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>

“No,” says Faust, “you cannot serve me, go back
whence you came.” He raps again, and another
servant enters, who tells Faust that he is as swift as
the wind. He also is sent away. A third servant is
as swift as thought and is accepted by Faust, who
orders him to bring food and drink for the feast.
The goblets are put on the table empty, but Faust asks
each of his guests what kind of wine or beer he would
like, holds the goblet out of the window and draws it
in again full of the desired liquor.</p>

<p>6. A famous Franciscan monk, named Dr. Kling,
who was well acquainted with Dr. Martin Luther,
endeavours to convert Faustus. But Faust declares
it would be dishonourable to go back on his pact with
the Devil, which he has signed with his own blood.
“The Devil has honourably kept his part of the
bargain, therefore I will keep mine.” The monk
reports this conversation to the Rector and Council of
the University, and Faust is compelled to quit Erfurt.</p>
</div>

<p>These stories are also to be found in a seventeenth-century
manuscript chronicle of Thuringia and the
town of Erfurt, based on an Erfurt Chronicle of the
previous century which is now lost. The author of
this earlier chronicle appears to have heard the anecdotes,
in the year 1556, from a neighbour of the Franciscan
monk who tried to convert Faust. The story of
how Faust rode the barrel of wine out of the cellar
is recorded in two paintings on the wall of Auerbach’s
wine-cellar in Leipzig, which bear the date 1525, but
are in reality no earlier than the seventeenth century.
The wine-cellar itself was not built till 1530.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>There were further editions of the Faust book in
1590 and 1592, as well as a rhymed version, which
appeared at Tübingen in the winter of 1587-8. It is
probably the authors of this book who are referred
to in the complaint of the ducal commissioners to the
senate of the University of Tübingen, which is recorded
in the minutes of the senate on the 15th of
April, 1588. The publisher and authors are ordered
to be incarcerated for a couple of days, and sternly
reprimanded.</p>

<p>In the year 1599 there was published at Hamburg
a considerably enlarged edition, of which the end of
each chapter was adorned with an edifying commentary,
called an <i>Erinnerung</i>, or Remonstrance, and it is this
version which became the basis of the subsequent
editions. The story becomes more anti-Catholic
than in the earlier editions, and the anti-papal moral is
driven home in each <i>Erinnerung</i>. The editor, Georg
Rudolf Widman, has successfully eliminated any
element of titanism or poetry which may have been
present in the original book, and Faust becomes merely
a young man led astray by the Church of Rome.
Widman has even been delicate enough to condense
the Helena episode to a mere reference in a footnote.</p>

<p>Widman’s version was again subjected to re-arrangement
in the year 1674, by the Nuremberg physician
Johann Nicolaus Pfitzer, who modified the former
polemic against the Catholic Church, and in 1725
Pfitzer’s version was published in abbreviated form by
an anonymous editor who called himself a <i>Christlich-Meynender</i>,
or Man of Christian Sentiments. This
volume is exceedingly slim, but it was sold everywhere

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>

and became the popular chap-book. It is important
in that it contains the germ of the Gretchen episode
in Goethe’s drama. Faust tries to seduce a servant-girl,
but she is proof against temptation and he offers to
marry her; Lucifer, however, dissuades him and
gives him Helena instead.</p>

<h3 id="FAUST_IN_ENGLAND">III</h3>
</div>

<div class="center large"><i>Faust in England</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> earliest mention of Faust in England is in a translation
by R. H. of a book by Ludwig Lavater, <i>Of
Ghostes and Spirites</i>, published in 1572:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“There are also conjurers founde even at this day,
who bragge of themselves that they can so by inchauntments
saddle an horse, that in a fewe houres they will
dispatch a very long journey. God at the last will
chasten these men with deserved punishment. What
straunge things are reported of one Faustus a German,
which he did in these our dayes by inchauntments?”</p>
</div>

<p><i>The History of the Damnable Life and Deserved
Death of Doctor John Faustus</i>, which was published
in London in 1592, was, as the title-page announces,
newly printed and in places amended, so there must
have been an earlier edition of which all trace is lost.
This was in all likelihood translated from the <i>editio
princeps</i> of 1587, but as we are uncertain of its date,
it is not impossible that one of the slightly later
German editions was used. There occurs in the
Stationers’ Registers under the date 28th of February,
1589, the entry of “A ballad of the life and deathe of
Doctor <span class="smcap">Faustus</span> the great Cunngerer. Allowed
under the hand of the Bishop of London.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>This ballad has been preserved only in later versions
of the seventeenth century,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and it is not possible to
say definitely whether or no it was founded on the
English translation of the German Faust book, though
that is the most likely theory. There is little
doubt that the latter appeared before the ballad.
In any case, <i>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</i>,
by Christopher Marlowe, which was in all probability
on the stage as early as 1589, was based directly, as is
shown by internal evidence, on the English Faust
book, and it is unlikely that Marlowe was acquainted
with the German version.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> So even if the ballad was
founded on Marlowe’s tragedy, which is very improbable,
and not on the English Faust book, the latter
must have been published an astonishingly short time
after the appearance of the original German <i>Historia</i>.
The translator is called P. F. <i>Gent.</i> (i.e. Gentleman,
and not, as some editors have thought, his surname),
but in later editions these initials appear as P. R. or
P. K. His identity cannot be established, and it is
not even possible to estimate definitely his knowledge
of German. To quote Logeman; “That P. F....
must have known some German is of course evident
from the whole of the translation and more especially
from some passages where a smaller light would have
blundered. But that his own cannot have shone very
brightly is apparent from the number of lesser and
greater blunders in which we have caught our translator,
and also from the fact that some passages which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>

present considerable difficulties will be found to have
been omitted.” We cannot, however, judge a sixteenth-century
translator by present-day standards, for he
was at liberty to adapt or modify as he listed. For
example, where the German original states that Faust
blew in the pope’s face, the translator renders <i>blew</i>
by <i>smote</i>, thus altering the whole sense, and it is doubtful
whether the false translation is due to P. F.’s sense
of humour or his ignorance of German. The description
of Florence is even more confused than in the
original, and he adds strange lore of his own, such as
the mythical story of the Brazen Virgin on the bridge
at Breslaw, who was used for the disposal of unruly
children. It is possible that P. F. had really visited
eastern Germany and the Polish or Galician regions,
such as Prague and Cracow, but it is just as likely
that he obtained his extra knowledge from a travelled
friend. He frequently tones down the German author’s
denunciation of Faust’s wicked ways, and emphasizes
the fantasies and cogitations rather than the presumption
and arrogance of the sorcerer. The English
Faust book is therefore the first step in the deepening
of the Faust character, and this conception is developed
by Marlowe.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>There is in the original legend of Faust little of
that titanic discontent with the spiritual limits of
humanity, which is now regarded as the fundamental
characteristic of the Faustian nature. It is not the
desire to solve the riddle of the universe that drives
him to the pact with the Devil, but the less worthy

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>

desire for power and pleasure. It is true that “he
took to himself eagles’ wings and wanted to fathom all
the causes in heaven and earth,” but the Promethean
defiance which some scholars have sought to establish
as his guiding motive, was a preconception implanted
in their own minds by a study of the Faust of Goethe.
The Faust of the <i>Historia</i> obliges the Devil to answer
all his questions and shows afterwards a lively interest
in the organization of heaven and hell, but the first-fruits
of the pact are food, wine and women. Even
Marlowe’s Faustus promises himself merely treasure,
delicacies and power from intercourse with the spirits;
philosophy, medicine, law and theology are all inadequate
for the man who longs to “raise the wind,
or rend the clouds,” but when his league with hell
has endowed him with supernatural powers, the only
use he finds for them is to gratify his sensual desires
or indulge in practical jokes. It cannot be said that
Marlowe has realized in his tragedy the potentiality
of the legend, though he seems to have had an inkling
of it. The Helen episode gives rise to the finest
poetical passage in the play:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container4">
 <div class="poetry">
   <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse-first-line">“Was this the face that launch’d a thousand ships,</div>
    <div class="verse">And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?”—</div>
   </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>and the final scene, with Faust’s death presaged by
the striking of the clock, is impressive, but the author
has done little to raise the conception to a higher plane.</p>

<p>After the production of Marlowe’s play the name
of Faustus appears to have become a household word,
and there are various allusions to the character in
contemporary writings, including a reference in
Shakespeare’s <i>Merry Wives</i>. William Prynne relates

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>

in his <i>Histrio-Mastix, The Players’ Scourge</i>, 1663, a
curious incident which occurred during a performance.
He is quoting the tragic end of many who have been
slain in playhouses in London, “Nor yet to recite
the sudden fearful burning even to the ground, both of
the Globe and Fortune Playhouses, no man perceiving
how these fires came: together with the visible
apparition of the Devil on the Stage at the Belsavage
Playhouse, in Queen Elizabeth’s days (to the great
amazement both of the Actors and Spectators) whiles
they were there profanely playing the History of Faustus,
... there being some distracted with that fearful sight.”</p>

<p>There was no further development of the theme in
this country, for it degenerated into a subject for farce
and pantomime. There were further editions of the
English Faust book, and in the year 1664 there was
published in London <i>The History of Doctor John
Faustus; Compiled in Verse, very pleasant and Delightfull</i>,
with a doggerel dedication to the reader:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container4">
 <div class="poetry">
   <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse-first-line">“Reader, I would not have you think,</div>
    <div class="verse">That I intend to waste my ink,</div>

    <div class="verse">And here do write his life in verse.</div>
    <div class="verse">For seeing Fryer Bacons Story,</div>

    <div class="verse">And when it cometh forth in print,</div>
    <div class="verse">If you like it not, the Devil’s in’t.”</div>
   </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>A farce by the actor W. Mountford, <i>Life and Death
of Doctor Faustus, with the Humours of Harlequin and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>

Scaramuch</i>, was acted at the Queen’s Theatre in
Dorset Gardens between 1684 and 1688, and revived
later at the theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. It was
borrowed for the most part, with the exception, of
course, of the harlequinade, from Marlowe.</p>

<p>The poet Alexander Pope declares that Faust was
the subject of a set of farces, which lasted in vogue two
or three seasons, and in which both Drury Lane and
Covent Garden strove to outdo each other for some
years. John Thurmond, a dancing master, composed
a <i>Harlequin Dr. Faustus</i>, which was performed at
Drury Lane, and published in the year 1724, and there
is a record of a <i>Harlequin Dr. Faustus, Pantomime;
altered from the Necromancer</i>, by a Mr. Woodward,
which was acted at Covent Garden as late as 1766.
These are but casual references to what must have
been numerous Faust farces, and there were in
addition performances of Faust puppet-plays in the
Punch and Judy Theatre of Martin Powell opposite
St. Paul’s Church in Covent Garden. Neither the
pantomimes nor the puppet-plays appear to derive
from Marlowe, but since the appearance of the latter’s
tragedy, the Faust story appears definitely to have
abandoned the epic form for the dramatic, and it is
in its original home, Germany, that further development
took place. Although in England the theme
degenerated until it was employed for the most insipid
type of theatrical entertainment, it was the English
dramatist who first gave it the form in which, two
centuries later, it was to inspire the greatest of all the
poets who have sought to express the strivings of
humanity in the figure of Faust.</p>

<h3 id="FAUST_DRAMA_IN_GERMANY">IV</h3>
</div>
<div class="center large"><i>The Faust Drama in Germany</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Throughout</span> the stagnant literary period of the
seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth,
it was not the various editions of the Faust book that
kept the legend green in Germany, but the popular
drama which developed from Marlowe’s <i>Faustus</i>.
Towards the end of the sixteenth century, companies
of English actors began to tour the Continent, and in
their repertories were the plays of the Elizabethans,
much mangled and adapted to the taste of their uncultivated
audiences. The popularity of these <i>English
Comedians</i>, as they were called, was greatest in Germany,
and we find traces of them throughout the first
half of the seventeenth century. Acting as a profession
began in Germany with these English companies.
At first they played only in English, but later they
produced German translations of their repertory,
even German original plays, and recruited their ranks
from among German actors. Soon German troupes
were formed on the same lines, who still, however,
called themselves “English Comedians,” since the
advertisement was of value. The English actors laid
great weight on visual effect, for the language difficulty
had at first to be surmounted. The actors themselves

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>

were for the most part minstrels and dancers, and the
most important character was the clown who appeared
in every production, however tragic it might be.
Even when the play was performed in English, the
clown spoke German, and he was known under various
names, such as <i>Pickelhäring</i>, while later on he was
called <i>Hans Wurst</i>. The plays were not written down
and there was plenty of scope allowed for gagging, so
that eventually they were distorted out of all recognition
and were practically the work of the actors themselves.
Among the plays which were produced and
gradually adapted in this manner was Marlowe’s
tragedy, and in its more spectacular form it provided
the public with the two somewhat contradictory essentials,
plenty of coarse humour and plenty of blood.</p>

<p>The earliest record of a performance of Marlowe’s
play by the English strolling players is one at Gräz
in 1608. In 1626, a <i>Tragödia von Dr. Faust</i> was produced
at Dresden on the 7th of July, and this was no
doubt also Marlowe’s play. We know what the main
outline of the popular drama must have been from a
comparison of the various puppet-plays which were
performed in comparatively recent times in Germany
and Austria, for when the Faust drama ceased to be
performed by living actors, it was taken over by the
proprietors of marionette theatres, and in this form
it survived till well into the nineteenth century. The
main points which the popular drama possessed in
common with Marlowe’s tragedy were the expository
opening monologue, the appearance of the good and
evil angels, and the presaging of Faust’s impending
end by the striking of the clock. The humorous and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>

melodramatic scenes had no doubt been supplemented
and exaggerated by other hands even on the English
stage. There is no ground for assuming that there was
already a Faust play of German origin on the German
stage before the arrival of the English Comedians.</p>

<p>The following is an amusing specimen of the type of
programme which was issued by the strolling players.
It refers to a performance by the famous Neuber
troupe in Hamburg, on the 7th of July, 1738<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The wicked Life and fearful End of the World-famous
Arch-sorcerer D. Johann Faust.</p>

<p>The following Scenes will be presented, among
others: A great outer Court in the underworld
Palace of Pluto, by the Rivers Lethe and Acheron. On
the River comes Charon in a Boat, and to him Pluto
on a fiery Dragon, followed by the whole of his underworld
Retinue and Spirits.</p>

<p>Dr. Faust’s Study and Library. An agreeable Spirit
of the upper World will sing the following touching
Aria, accompanied by tender Music:</p>

<p class="center">[A song of three verses.]</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>A Raven flies out of the Air and fetches the Manuscript
of Dr. Faust. Hans Wurst breaks in accidentally
on his Master, Dr. Faust’s Magic. He must stand
still and cannot move from the spot until he has
taken off his Shoes. The Shoes then dance together
in a merry Manner.</p>

<p>An insolent Court-menial, who mocks Dr. Faust,
is endowed with a pair of Horns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>A Peasant buys a Horse from Dr. Faust, and as
soon as he rides it, the Horse turns into a Bundle of
Hay. The Peasant wants to call Dr. Faust to Account,
Faust pretends to be asleep, the Peasant tugs him and
pulls off his Leg.</p>

<p>Hans Wurst wants to have a lot of Money, and to
please him, Mephostophiles causes him to rain Money.</p>

<p>The lovely Helena sings, to the Accompaniment of
pleasant Music, an Aria which is unpleasant to Dr.
Faust, for it presages his Doom.</p>

<p>Dr. Faust takes Leave from his Famulus Christoph
Wagner. Hans Wurst also departs, and the Spirits
fetch Dr. Faust to the Accompaniment of Fire-works,
which play in an ingenious Manner.</p>

<p>The underworld Palace of Pluto is seen once more.
The Furies have Possession of Dr. Faust and dance
a Ballet round him, because they have brought him
safely into their Domain.</p>

<p>The Rest will be more pleasant in the Seeing then
here in the Reading.</p>

<p>Commencement at half past four, in the so-called
Opera House in the Goosemarket at Hamburg.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another programme from Frankfort of the year
1742 announces that after the play there will be a dance,
after the dance a ballet, and if time permits, after the
ballet there will be a merry comedy.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen to what depths the story of
Faust had fallen, before the time came to raise it to
the plane of the world’s greatest tragedies. It was
Lessing who first saw the potentialities of the theme,
and he pointed them out in the famous seventeenth

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>

<i>Literaturbrief</i> of the 16th of February, 1759, which
commenced a new era for German literature, henceforth
to turn away from French models and seek
inspiration from Shakespeare. The stilted superficiality
of French literature was to yield to the more
congenial vigour of the English. It is true that Lessing
did not recognize the worth of Marlowe, who stood
in the shadow of his greater contemporary, but he
declares that the old German plays had possessed
much of the English quality. “To mention only the
best known of them: <i>Doctor Faust</i> has a number of
scenes, which could only have been imagined by a
Shakespearean genius. And how deeply was, and in
part still is, Germany in love with her Doctor Faust!
One of my friends possesses an old draft of this tragedy,
and he has communicated a scene to me in which
there is undoubtedly much that is great.” He then
prints a scene, which was really composed by himself,
and among his papers after his death were found
sketches relating to his plan for a Faust drama. It is
certain that Lessing intended to reject the obsolete
orthodox view that Faust must necessarily pay for
his sins by an eternity of damnation. The Catholic
theologians had permitted sorcerers to be saved by
repentance, but the spirit of the Reformation demanded
that Faust forfeit his soul, and from this inevitable
doom there was no appeal. The age of Enlightenment,
on the other hand, looked upon the intellect as supreme,
and it was obviously absurd that Faust’s attempt to
solve an intellectual problem should lead to the loss
of his soul. It is to Lessing that is due the fundamental
change in the conception of the Faust problem,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>

whereby Faust is not damned, but saved. The longing
to penetrate the mysteries of the universe is no longer
regarded as an instinct implanted in humanity by the
Devil.</p>

<p>So far as we can judge from the fragments, Lessing’s
Faust was to be driven to the pact solely by his thirst
for knowledge. Goethe was to create the eternal
type, the man who seeks to encompass the universe,
who demands complete and ultimate satisfaction for
the limitless craving of the human soul. The first
impulse to create a Faust drama of his own came to
Goethe from a marionette version of the popular
drama, a performance of which he saw in Leipzig in
his student days, for he never saw it performed by
living actors, and neither the Folk book nor Marlowe’s
tragedy came into his hands until much later. It was
a task which occupied him all his life. His original
draft, the <i>Urfaust</i>, has only been discovered in manuscript
in recent times, but in the year 1790 he published
<i>Faust. A Fragment.</i> The first part of the completed
tragedy appeared in 1808, and the second part in 1833,
a year after Goethe’s death.</p>

<p>The fundamental difference between Goethe’s
conception of the problem and all that had gone
before is typified in the fact that it is not a <i>pact</i> into
which Faust enters with Mephisto, but a <i>wager</i>. There
are indeed two wagers. In the Prologue in Heaven,
Mephisto discusses Faust with the Lord and says,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The opening monologue, which shows Faust in
his study fighting with the realization that “here,
poor fool! with all my lore I stand, no wiser than
before,” is an echo of the initial monologue of Marlowe’s
tragedy, which came to Goethe through the
medium of the popular drama and the puppet-show.
Hitherto the pact had been for a definite period of
twenty-four years, during which Faust was to enjoy
all that the Devil could give him and then to fulfil
without hope of mercy his part of the bargain.
Goethe’s Faust, however, demands more than the
fulfilment of transitory desires. He wants to grasp
the moment of supreme satisfaction, and if Mephisto
cannot give him that, Faust’s soul remains his own:—</p>

<p>That is the important point. Mephisto plunges
Faust in the pleasures of revelry, love, power and classic
beauty, but in spite of his burning craving for supreme
happiness, he is incapable of enjoying the blissful
moment. There never is a fleeting moment to which
he can say “Ah, still delay—thou art so fair!” There
is no absolute truth or absolute beauty, and therefore
no absolute happiness. The blissful moment does
not exist, and the only satisfaction which man is free
to enjoy is in striving after an imaginary absolute.
Faust never becomes absorbed in a moment of ecstasy
and therefore the Devil loses the wager. By using
his power unselfishly to further the lot of others, he
is the instrument of his own salvation; he redeems
himself by an ever higher and purer form of activity,
as Goethe himself said, and dies with the conviction
that</p>

 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse-first-line">“He only earns his freedom and existence,</div>
    <div class="verse">Who daily conquers them anew.”</div>
   </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Mephisto summons his devils to carry the
soul to hell, a host of angels flies from heaven to repel
them, and as they bear Faust’s immortal soul into the
upper air, they proclaim</p>

<div class="poetry-container4">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse-first-line">“Whoe’er aspires unweariedly</div>
    <div class="verse">Is not beyond redeeming.”</div>
   </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Devil had not given Faust the blissful moment,
but had only enabled him to find a compromise
between dream and reality by creative work. Faust’s
craving remained unfulfilled, and his reconcilement
to the conditions of life was only temporary. But
as that is the only possibility, as man’s highest

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>

aspirations never can be completely satisfied, the
wager was from the first destined to be unfulfilled.</p>

<p>In Goethe’s <i>Faust</i> the theme received the highest
treatment of which it was capable. At the time when
he first came in contact with the story, Faust dramas
were being announced by authors from all corners of
Germany, and perhaps it would not be too much to
say that every German poet since Goethe has cherished
the hope of some day creating his own Faust. Of
the tragedies, farces, operas, pantomimes, ballets,
novels, short stories, poems, folk-songs and even
parodies on the subject, it may be said that their name
is legion, and it appears to have been cast into every
possible art-form. It will, perhaps, suffice to mention
here a dance-poem which was written by the poet
Heinrich Heine in 1851 for performance at Drury
Lane. Lumley, the director of the theatre, had already
made preparations for the production, when it was
laid aside as unsuitable. One of the latest treatments
of the theme is <i>Faust and the City</i>, by Lunacharski,
the Minister of Education in Soviet Russia.</p>

<h3 id="THE_WAGNER_BOOK">V</h3>
<div class="center large"><i>The Wagner Book</i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first edition of the German Wagner book was
published anonymously, without mention even of its
place of origin, in 1593, under a title of which the
following is a translation:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Second part of D. Johann Faust’s History, in which
is described the Pact of Christopher Wagner, Faust’s
former Disciple, contracted with the Devil, called
Auerhan, who appeared to him in the form of an Ape,
also his adventurous Ribaldries and Pranks, which he
performed with the Aid of the Devil, and fearful End
which at last overtook him.</i></p>

<p><i>Together with an excellent Description of the New
Isles, what People live therein, what Fruits grow there,
what Religion and Idol-worship they have there, and
how they are captured by the Spaniards, all drawn from
his posthumous Writings and, for it is very amusing to
read, put into Print. By Fridericus Schotus Tolet:
Now at P. 1593.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Unlike the publisher of the Faust book, the author
of the Wagner book appears to have taken all precautions
to hide his identity, for Fridericus Schotus is
a pseudonym, and Tolet is Toledo, where there were
supposed to be celebrated schools of magic. At the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>

end of his book the author declares that he has
translated from a Spanish original, printed seventy
years ago, which he received from a Brother Martin
of the Order of St. Benedict. That is obviously
false, since the Faust legend did not exist in 1523, and
certainly could not have been in print in Spain. The
author also declares that he has refrained from saying
anything that might be considered detrimental to the
Church of Rome, but this promise he has not kept
very successfully. In an edition which appeared in
the following year, the town of origin is given as
“Gerapoli,” which is fictitious and may contain an
anagram of “Prague,” since the first edition states
that it was published at “P.”</p>

<p>The Wagner story is essentially a paraphrase of the
Faust legend, and the author keeps to the outline of
his hero’s character which is given in the Faust book.
The sole difference is in some of the external incidents.</p>

<p>The English Wagner book was licensed about six
months after the German Wagner book, according
to an entry in the Stationers’ Registers under the 16th
of November, 1593, and the date on the title-page
is 1594. It is <i>not</i> a translation of the German
Wagner book, but an extremely faint imitation,
into which the author has introduced many new
details. He appears only to have taken the basic
idea, though there are occasional quotations from the
German book, and it is practically an independent
work. The 1680 edition was, in fact, translated into
German and published in Scheible’s <cite>Kloster</cite>.</p>

A Discourse of the most famous Doctor
John Faustus of Wittenberg in Germanie, Coniurer,
and Necromancer: wherein is declared many strange
things that he himselfe hath seene, and done in the

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h3>
<div class="center"><i>Of his Parentage and Birth</i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">J</span>OHN FAUSTUS, born in the town of Rhode,
lying in the province of Weimer in Germanie,
his father a poor husbandman, and not able well to
bring him up: but having an uncle at Wittenberg,
a rich man, and without issue, took this J. Faustus
from his father, and made him his heir, in so much
that his father was no more troubled with him, for he
remained with his uncle at Wittenberg, where he was
kept at the University in the same city to study
Divinity. But Faustus being of a naughty mind and
otherwise addicted, applied not his studies, but took
himself to other exercises: the which his uncle often-times
hearing, rebuked him for it, as Eli oft-times
rebuked his children for sinning against the Lord:
even so this good man laboured to have Faustus apply
his study of Divinity, that he might come to the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>

knowledge of God and his laws. But it is manifest
that many virtuous parents have wicked children, as
Cain, Ruben, Absolom, and such-like have been to
their parents: so this Faustus having godly parents,
and seeing him to be of a toward wit, were very
desirous to bring him up in those virtuous studies,
namely, of Divinity: but he gave himself secretly to
study Necromancy and Conjuration, in so much that
few or none could perceive his profession.</p>

<p>But to the purpose: Faustus continued at study in
the University, and was by the Rectors and sixteen
Masters afterwards examined how he had profited
in his studies; and being found by them, that none
for his time were able to argue with him in Divinity,
or for the excellency of his wisdom to compare with
him, with one consent they made him Doctor of
Divinity. But Doctor Faustus within short time
after he had obtained his degree, fell into such fantasies
and deep cogitations, that he was marked of
many, and of the most part of the Students was called
the Speculator; and sometime he would throw the
Scriptures from him as though he had no care of his
former profession: so that he began a very ungodly
life, as hereafter more at large may appear; for the
old proverb saith, Who can hold that will away?
so, who can hold Faustus from the Devil, that seeks
after him with all his endeavour? For he accompanied
himself with divers that were seen in those
Devilish Arts, and that had the Chaldean, Persian,
Hebrew, Arabian, and Greek tongues, using Figures,
Characters, Conjurations, Incantations, with many
other ceremonies belonging to these infernal Arts,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>

as Necromancy, Charms, Soothsaying, Witchcraft,
Enchantment, being delighted with their books,
words, and names so well, that he studied day and
night therein: in so much that he could not abide
to be called Doctor of Divinity, but waxed a worldly
man, and named himself an Astrologian, and a Mathematician:
and for a shadow sometimes a Physician,
and did great cures, namely, with herbs, roots, waters,
drinks, receipts, and clysters. And without doubt he
was passing wise, and excellent perfect in the holy
scriptures: but he that knoweth his master’s will and
doth it not, is worthy to be beaten with many stripes.
It is written, no man can serve two masters: and,
thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God: but Faustus
threw all this in the wind, and made his soul of no
estimation, regarding more his worldly pleasure than
the joys to come: therefore at the day of judgment

Art, and how he conjured the Devil, making him

own house</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> have heard before, that all Faustus’ mind was set
to study the arts of Necromancy and Conjuration, the
which exercise he followed day and night: and taking
to him the wings of an Eagle, thought to fly over the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>

whole world, and to know the secrets of heaven and
earth; for his Speculation was so wonderful, being
expert in using his Vocabula, Figures, Characters,
Conjurations, and other Ceremonial actions, that in
all the haste he put in practice to bring the Devil
before him. And taking his way to a thick Wood near
to Wittenberg, called in the German tongue Spisser
Waldt: that is in English the Spissers Wood (as
Faustus would often-times boast of it among his crew
being in his jollity), he came into the same wood
towards evening into a cross way, where he made
with a wand a Circle in the dust, and within that many
more Circles and Characters: and thus he passed
away the time, until it was nine or ten of the clock
in the night, then began Doctor Faustus to call for
Mephostophiles the Spirit, and to charge him in the
name of Beelzebub to appear there personally without
any long stay: then presently the Devil began so
great a rumour in the Wood, as if heaven and earth
would have come together with wind, the trees bowing
their tops to the ground, then fell the Devil to blare as
if the whole Wood had been full of Lions, and suddenly
about the Circle ran the Devil as if a thousand
Wagons had been running together on paved stones.
After this at the four corners of the Wood it thundered
horribly, with such lightnings as if the whole world,
to his seeming, had been on fire. Faustus all this while
half amazed at the Devil’s so long tarrying, and doubting
whether he were best to abide any more such horrible
Conjurings, thought to leave his Circle and
depart; whereupon the Devil made him such music
of all sorts, as if the Nymphs themselves had been in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>

place: whereat Faustus was revived and stood stoutly
in his circle aspecting his purpose, and began again
to conjure the Spirit Mephostophiles in the name of
the Prince of Devils to appear in his likeness: whereat
suddenly over his head hanged hovering in the air
a mighty Dragon: then calls Faustus again after his
Devilish manner, at which there was a monstrous
cry in the Wood, as if Hell had been open, and all
the tormented souls crying to God for mercy; presently
not three fathoms above his head fell a flame
in manner of a lightning, and changed itself into a
Globe: yet Faustus feared it not, but did persuade
himself that the Devil should give him his request
before he would leave: Often-times after to his companions
he would boast, that he had the stoutest head
(under the cope of heaven) at commandment: whereat
they answered, they knew none stouter than the Pope
or Emperor: but Doctor Faustus said, the head that
is my servant is above all on earth, and repeated certain
words out of Saint Paul to the Ephesians to make his
argument good: The Prince of this world is upon
earth and under heaven. Well, let us come again
to his Conjuration where we left him at his fiery
Globe: Faustus vexed at the Spirit’s so long tarrying,
used his Charms with full purpose not to depart
before he had his intent, and crying on Mephostophiles
the Spirit; suddenly the Globe opened and sprang
up in height of a man: so burning a time, in the end
it converted to the shape of a fiery man. This pleasant
beast ran about the Circle a great while, and lastly
appeared in manner of a gray Friar, asking Faustus
what was his request. Faustus commanded that the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>

next morning at twelve of the clock he should appear
to him at his house; but the Devil would in no wise
grant. Faustus began again to conjure him in the
name of Beelzebub, that he should fulfil his request:
whereupon the Spirit agreed, and so they departed
each one his way.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h3 id="HIST_CHAP_III">CHAPTER III</h3>
<div class="center"><i>The conference of Doctor Faustus with the Spirit
Mephostophiles the morning following at his<br>
own house</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> having commanded the Spirit to
be with him, at his hour appointed he came and
appeared in his chamber, demanding of Faustus
what his desire was: then began Doctor Faustus
anew with him to conjure him that he should be
obedient unto him, and to answer him certain Articles,
and to fulfil them in all points.</p>

<p class="p2">1. That the Spirit should serve him and be obedient
unto him in all things that he asked of him from that
hour until the hour of his death.</p>

<p class="p2">2. Farther, anything that he desired of him he should
bring it to him.</p>

<p class="p2">3. Also, that in all Faustus his demands or Interrogations,
the Spirit should tell him nothing but that
which is true.</p>

<p>Hereupon the Spirit answered and laid his case
forth, that he had no such power of himself, until

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>

he had first given his Prince (that was ruler over him)
to understand thereof, and to know if he could obtain
so much of his Lord: therefore speak farther that I
may do thy whole desire to my Prince: for it is not
in my power to fulfil without his leave. Shew me the
cause why (said Faustus). The Spirit answered:
Faustus, thou shalt understand, that with us it is
even as well a kingdom, as with you on earth: yea,
we have our rulers and servants, as I my self am one,
and we name our whole number the Legion: for although
that Lucifer is thrust and fallen out of heaven
through his pride and high mind, yet he hath notwithstanding
a Legion of Devils at his commandment,
that we call the Oriental Princes; for his power is
great and infinite. Also there is an host in Meridie,
in Septentrio, in Occidente: and for that Lucifer
hath his kingdom under heaven, we must change and
give ourselves unto men to serve them at their pleasure.
It is also certain, we have never as yet opened unto
any man the truth of our dwelling, neither of our
ruling, neither what our power is, neither have we
given any man any gift, or learned him anything,
except he promise to be ours.</p>

<p>Doctor Faustus upon this arose where he sat,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and
said, I will have my request, and yet I will not be
damned. The Spirit answered, Then shalt thou want
thy desire, and yet art thou mine notwithstanding:
if any man would detain thee it is in vain, for thine
infidelity hath confounded thee.</p>

<p>Hereupon spake Faustus: Get thee hence from me,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>

and take Saint Valentine’s farewell and Crisam<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> with
thee, yet I conjure thee that thou be here at evening,
and bethink thyself on that I have asked thee, and ask
thy Prince’s counsel therein. Mephostophiles the
Spirit, thus answered, vanished away, leaving Faustus
in his study, where he sat pondering with himself
how he might obtain his request of the Devil without
loss of his soul: yet fully he was resolved in himself,
rather than to want his pleasure, to do whatsoever
the Spirit and his Lord should condition upon.</p>

<div class="center"><i>The second time of the Spirit’s appearing to Faustus
in his house, and of their parley</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Faustus</span> continuing in his Devilish cogitations, never
moving out of the place where the Spirit left him
(such was his fervent love to the Devil) the night
approaching, this swift flying Spirit appeared to
Faustus, offering himself with all submission to his
service, with full authority from his Prince to do
whatsoever he would request, if so be Faustus would
promise to be his: this answer I bring thee, and an
answer must thou make by me again, yet will I hear
what is thy desire, because thou hast sworn me to be
here at this time. Doctor Faustus gave him this answer,
though faintly (for his soul’s sake), That his request

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>

was none other but to become a Devil, or at the least
a limb of him, and that the Spirit should agree unto
these Articles as followeth.</p>

<p class="p2">1. That he might be a Spirit in shape and quality.</p>

<p class="p2">2. That Mephostophiles should be his servant,
and at his commandment.</p>

<p class="p2">3. That Mephostophiles should bring him anything,
and do for him whatsoever.</p>

<p class="p2">4. That at all times he should be in his house,
invisible to all men, except only to himself, and at
his commandment to shew himself.</p>

<p class="p2">5. Lastly, that Mephostophiles should at all times
appear at his command, in what form or shape soever
he would.</p>

<p>Upon these points the Spirit answered Doctor
Faustus, that all this should be granted him and fulfilled,
and more if he would agree unto him upon
certain Articles as followeth.</p>

<p class="p2">First, that Doctor Faustus should give himself to
his Lord Lucifer, body and soul.</p>

<p class="p2">Secondly, for confirmation of the same, he should
make him a writing, written with his own blood.</p>

<p class="p2">Thirdly, that he would be an enemy to all Christian
people.</p>

<p class="p2">Fourthly, that he would deny his Christian belief.</p>

<p class="p2">Fifthly, that he let not any man change his opinion,
if so be any man should go about to dissuade, or
withdraw him from it.</p>

<p>Further, the Spirit promised Faustus to give him
certain years to live in health and pleasure, and when
such years were expired, that then Faustus should
be fetched away, and if he should hold these Articles

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>

and conditions, that then he should have all whatsoever
his heart would wish or desire; and that Faustus
should quickly perceive himself to be a Spirit in all
manner of actions whatsoever. Hereupon Doctor
Faustus his mind was so inflamed, that he forgot his
soul, and promised Mephostophiles to hold all things
as he had mentioned them: he thought the Devil
was not so black as they used to paint him, nor Hell so
hot as the people say, <i>etc.</i></p>

<hr class="chap">

<h3 id="HIST_CHAP_V">CHAPTER V</h3>
<div class="center"><i>The third parley between Doctor Faustus and
Mephostophiles about a conclusion</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Doctor Faustus had made his promise to the
Devil, in the morning betimes he called the Spirit
before him and commanded him that he should
always come to him like a Friar, after the order of
Saint Francis, with a bell in his hand like Saint
Anthony, and to ring it once or twice before he appeared,
that he might know of his certain coming:
Then Faustus demanded the Spirit, what was his
name? The Spirit answered, my name is as thou
sayest, Mephostophiles, and I am a prince, but servant
to Lucifer: and all the circuit from Septentrio to
the Meridian, I rule under him. Even at these words
was this wicked wretch Faustus inflamed, to hear himself
to have gotten so great a Potentate to be his servant,
forgot the Lord his maker, and Christ his redeemer,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>

became an enemy unto all mankind, yea, worse than
the Giants whom the Poets feign to climb the hills to
make war with the Gods: not unlike that enemy
of God and his Christ, that for his pride was cast into
Hell: so likewise Faustus forgot that the high
climbers catch the greatest falls, and that the sweetest
meat requires the sourest sauce.</p>

<p>After a while, Faustus promised Mephostophiles
to write and make his Obligation, with full assurance
of the Articles in the Chapter before rehearsed. A
pitiful case, (Christian Reader), for certainly this Letter
or Obligation was found in his house after his most
lamentable end, with all the rest of his damnable
practices used in his whole life. Therefore I wish all
Christians to take an example by this wicked Faustus,
and to be comforted in Christ, contenting themselves
with that vocation whereunto it hath pleased God to
call them, and not to esteem the vain delights of this
life, as did this unhappy Faustus, in giving his Soul
to the Devil: and to confirm it the more assuredly,
he took a small penknife, and pricked a vein in his
left hand, and for certainty thereupon, were seen on
his hand these words written, as if they had been
written with blood, Ô HOMO FUGE: whereat the
Spirit vanished, but Faustus continued in his damnable
mind, and made his writing as followeth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I, Johannes Faustus</span>, Doctor, do openly acknowledge

not found through the gift that is given me from above,
any such learning and wisdom, that can bring me to

to instruct me any farther in the matter, now have I
Doctor John Faustus, unto the hellish prince of

both body and soul, upon such condition, that they
shall learn me, and fulfil my desire in all things, as
they have promised and vowed unto me, with due

all living creatures that bear the shape of God, yea all

<div class="center"><i>How Mephostophiles came for his writing, and in
what manner he appeared, and his sights he
shewed him: and how he caused him to keep
a copy of his own writing</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> sitting pensive, having but one only
boy with him, suddenly there appeared his Spirit
Mephostophiles, in likeness of a fiery man, from whom
issued most horrible fiery flames, in so much that the
boy was afraid, but being hardened by his master, he
bade him stand still and he should have no harm:
the Spirit began to blare as in a singing manner.
This pretty sport pleased Doctor Faustus well, but
he would not call his Spirit into his Counting house,
until he had seen more: anon was heard a rushing of
armed men, and trampling of horses: this ceasing,
came a kennel of hounds, and they chased a great

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>

Hart in the hall, and there the Hart was slain. Faustus
took heart, came forth, and looked upon the Hart,
but presently before him there was a Lion and a
Dragon together fighting, so fiercely, that Faustus
thought they would have brought down the house,
but the Dragon overcame the Lion, and so they
vanished.</p>

<p>After this, came in a Peacock, with a Peahen, the
cock brustling of his tail, and turning to the female,
beat her, and so vanished. Afterward followed a
furious Bull, that with a full fierceness ran upon
Faustus, but coming near him, vanished away. Afterward
followed a great old Ape, this Ape offered
Faustus the hand, but he refused: so the Ape ran
out of the hall again. Hereupon fell a mist in the hall,
that Faustus saw no light, but it lasted not, and so
soon as it was gone, there lay before Faustus two great
sacks, one full of gold, the other full of silver.</p>

<p>Lastly, was heard by Faustus all manner Instruments
of music, as Organs, Clarigolds,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Lutes, Viols,
Citterns,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Waits,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Hornpipes, Flutes, Anomes,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Harps,
and all manner of other Instruments, the which so
ravished his mind, that he thought he had been in
another world, forgot both body and soul, in so much
that he was minded never to change his opinion concerning
that which he had done. Hereat, came Mephostophiles
into the Hall to Faustus, in apparel like unto
a Friar, to whom Faustus spake, thou hast done me
a wonderful pleasure in shewing me this pastime,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>

if thou continue as thou hast began, thou shalt win
me heart and soul, yea and have it. Mephostophiles
answered, this is nothing, I will please thee better:
yet that thou mayest know my power and all, ask what
thou wilt request of me, that shalt thou have, conditionally
hold thy promise, and give me thy handwriting:
at which words, the wretch thrust forth his hand,
saying, hold thee, there hast thou my promise:
Mephostophiles took the writing, and willing Faustus
to take a copy of it, with that the perverse Faustus
being resolute in his damnation, wrote a copy thereof,
and gave the Devil the one, and kept in store the other.
Thus the Spirit and Faustus were agreed, and dwelt
together: no doubt there was a virtuous housekeeping.</p>

renouncing all the powers of heaven, confirming this
lamentable action with his own blood, and having
already delivered his writing now into the Devil’s
hand, the which so puffed up his heart, that he had
forgot the mind of a man, and thought rather himself
to be a spirit. This Faustus dwelt in his uncle’s house
at Wittenberg, who died, and bequeathed it in his
Testament to his Cousin Faustus. Faustus kept a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>

boy with him that was his scholar, an unhappy wag,
called Christopher Wagner, to whom this sport and
life that he saw his master follow seemed pleasant.
Faustus loved the boy well, hoping to make him as
good or better seen in his Devilish exercise than himself;
and he was fellow with Mephostophiles: otherwise
Faustus had no more company in his house; but
himself, his boy and his Spirit, that ever was diligent
at Faustus’ command, going about the house, clothed
like a Friar, with a little bell in his hand, seen of none
but Faustus. For his victual and other necessaries,
Mephostophiles brought him at his pleasure from the
Duke of Saxon, the Duke of Bavaria, and the Bishop
of Saltzburg: for they had many times their best wine
stolen out of their cellars by Mephostophile: Likewise
their provision for their own table, such meat as
Faustus wished for, his Spirit brought him in: besides
that, Faustus himself was become so cunning, that
when he opened his window, what fowl soever he
wished for, it came presently flying into his house,
were it never so dainty. Moreover, Faustus and his
boy went in sumptuous apparel, the which Mephostophiles
stole from the Mercers at Norenberg, Auspurg,
Franckeford, and Liptzig: for it was hard for them to
find a lock to keep out such a thief. All their maintenance
was but stolen and borrowed ware: and thus
they lived an odious life in the sight of God, though
as yet the world were unacquainted with their wickedness.
It must be so, for their fruits be none other:
as Christ saith through John, where he calls the Devil
a thief, and a murderer: and that found Faustus, for
he stole him away both body and soul.</p><hr class="chap">

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> continued thus in his Epicurish
life day and night, and believed not that there was
a God, hell, or Devil: he thought that body and soul
died together, and had quite forgotten Divinity or
the immortality of his soul, but stood in his damnable
heresy day and night. And bethinking himself of
a wife, called Mephostophiles to counsel; which
would in no wise agree: demanding of him if he
would break the covenant made with him, or if he
had forgot it. Hast not thou (quoth Mephostophiles)
sworn thyself an enemy to God and all creatures?
To this I answer thee, thou canst not marry; thou
canst not serve two masters, God, and my Prince:
for wedlock is a chief institution ordained of God,
and that hast thou promised to defy, as we do all, and
that hast thou also done: and moreover thou hast
confirmed it with thy blood: persuade thyself, that
what thou dost in contempt of wedlock, it is all to
thine own delight. Therefore Faustus, look well
about thee, and bethink thyself better, and I wish
thee to change thy mind: for if thou keep not what
thou hast promised in thy writing, we will tear thee
in pieces like the dust under thy feet. Therefore
sweet Faustus, think with what unquiet life, anger,
strife, and debate thou shalt live in when thou takest
a wife: therefore change thy mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Doctor Faustus was with these speeches in despair:
and as all that have forsaken the Lord, can build upon
no good foundation: so this wretched Faustus having
forsook the rock, fell in despair with himself, fearing
if he should motion Matrimony any more, that the
Devil would tear him in pieces. For this time (quoth
he to Mephostophiles) I am not minded to marry.
Then you do well, answered his Spirit. But shortly
and that within two hours after, Faustus called his
Spirit, which came in his old manner like a Friar.
Then Faustus said unto him, I am not able to resist
nor bridle my fantasy, I must and will have a wife,
and I pray thee give thy consent to it. Suddenly
upon these words came such a whirlwind about the
place, that Faustus thought the whole house would
come down, all the doors in the house flew off the
hooks: after all this, his house was full of smoke,
and the floor covered over with ashes: which when
Doctor Faustus perceived, he would have gone up the
stairs: and flying up, he was taken and thrown into
the hall, that he was not able to stir hand nor foot:
then round about him ran a monstrous circle of fire,
never standing still, that Faustus fried as he lay, and
thought there to have been burned. Then cried he
out to his Spirit Mephostophiles for help, promising
him he would live in all things as he had vowed in his
handwriting. Hereupon appeared unto him an ugly
Devil, so fearful and monstrous to behold, that
Faustus durst not look on him. The Devil said, what
wouldst thou have Faustus? how likest thou thy
wedding? what mind art thou in now? Faustus
answered, he had forgot his promise, desiring him of
pardon, and he would talk no more of such things.
The Devil answered, thou were best so to do, and so
vanished.</p>

hast vowed, and we will perform as we have promised:
and more than that, thou shalt have thy heart’s

a time his Mephostophiles to him: which being come,
brought with him a book in his hand of all manner
of Devilish and enchanted arts, the which he gave
Faustus, saying: hold my Faustus, work now thy
heart’s desire: The copy of this enchanting book

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>

was afterward found by his servant Christopher
Wagner. Well (quoth Faustus to his Spirit) I have
called thee to know what thou canst do if I have need
of thy help. Then answered Mephostophiles and said,
my Lord Faustus, I am a flying spirit: yea, so swift as
thought can think, to do whatsoever. Here Faustus
said: but how came thy Lord and master Lucifer to
have so great a fall from heaven? Mephostophiles
answered: My Lord Lucifer was a fair Angel, created
of God as immortal, and being placed in the Seraphims,
which are above the Cherubims, he would have presumed
unto the Throne of God, with intent to have
thrust God out of his seat. Upon this presumption
the Lord cast him down headlong, and where before
he was an Angel of light, now dwells he in darkness,
not able to come near his first place, without God
send for him to appear before him as Raphael: but
unto the lower degree of Angels that have their conversation
with men he was come, but not unto the
second degree of Heavens that is kept by the Archangels,
namely, Michael and Gabriel, for these are
called Angels of God’s wonders: yet are these far
inferior places to that from whence my Lord and
Master Lucifer fell. And thus far Faustus, because
thou art one of the beloved children of my Lord
Lucifer, following and feeding thy mind in manner as
he did his, I have shortly resolved thy request, and
more I will do for thee at thy pleasure. I thank thee
Mephostophiles (quoth Faustus) come let us now
go rest, for it is night: upon this they left their communication.</p>

<div class="center"><i>How Doctor Faustus dreamed that he had seen hell
in his sleep, and how he questioned with his
Spirit of matters as concerning hell, with the
Spirit’s answer</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night following, after Faustus his communication
had with Mephostophiles, as concerning the fall of
Lucifer, Doctor Faustus dreamed that he had seen
a part of hell: but in what manner it was, or in what
place he knew not: whereupon he was greatly troubled
in mind, and called unto him Mephostophiles his
Spirit, saying to him, my Mephostophiles, I pray thee
resolve me in this doubt: what is hell, what substance
is it of, in what place stands it, and when was it made?
Mephostophiles answered: my Faustus, thou shalt
know, that before the fall of my Lord Lucifer there was
no hell, but even then was hell ordained: it is of no
substance, but a confused thing: for I tell thee, that
before all Elements were made, and the earth seen,
the Spirit of God moved on the waters, and darkness
was over all: but when God said, let it be light, it
was so at his word, and the light was on God’s right
hand, and God praised the light. Judge thou further:
God stood in the middle, the darkness was on his left
hand, in the which my Lord was bound in chains
until the day of judgment: in this confused hell is
nought to find but a filthy, Sulphurish, fiery, stinking
mist or fog. Further, we Devils know not what
substance it is of, but a confused thing. For as a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span>

bubble of water flieth before the wind, so doth hell
before the breath of God. Further, we Devils know
not how God hath laid the foundation of our hell,
nor whereof it is: but to be short with thee Faustus,
we know that hell hath neither bottom nor end.</p>

<p>Faustus spake again to Mephostophiles, saying:
thou speakest of wonderful things, I pray thee now
tell me what Kingdoms is there in your hell, how many
are there, what are they called, and who rules them:
the Spirit answered him: my Faustus, know that
hell is as thou wouldst think with thyself another
world, in the which we have our being, under the
earth, and above the earth, even to the Heavens;
within the circumference whereof are contained ten
Kingdoms, namely:</p>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>

Belial in Meridie, Astaroth in Occidente, and Phlegeton

<div class="center"><i>Another question put forth by Doctor Faustus to his
Spirit concerning his Lord Lucifer, with the
sorrow that Faustus fell afterwards into</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> began again to reason with Mephostophiles,
requiring him to tell him in what form and
shape, and in what estimation his Lord Lucifer was
when he was in favour with God. Whereupon his
Spirit required of him three days’ respite, which
Faustus granted. The three days being expired,
Mephostophiles gave him this answer: Faustus, my
Lord Lucifer (so called now, for that he was banished
out of the clear light of heaven) was at the first an
Angel of God, he sat on the Cherubims, and saw all
the wonderful works of God, yea he was so of God
ordained, for shape, pomp, authority, worthiness, and
dwelling, that he far exceeded all other the creatures
of God, yea our gold and precious stones: and so
illuminated, that he far surpassed the brightness of
the Sun and all other Stars: wherefore God placed
him on the Cherubims, where he had a kingly office,
and was always before God’s seat, to the end he might
be the more perfect in all his beings: but when he

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>

began to be high-minded, proud, and so presumptuous
that he would usurp the seat of his Majesty, then was
he banished out from amongst the heavenly powers,
separated from their abiding into the manner of a
fiery stone, that no water is able to quench, but continually
burneth until the end of the world.</p>

<p>Doctor Faustus, when he had heard the words of
his Spirit, began to consider with himself, having
diverse and sundry opinions in his head: and very
pensively (saying nothing unto his Spirit) he went into
his chamber, and laid him on his bed, recording the
words of Mephostophiles; which so pierced his
heart, that he fell into sighing and great lamentation,
crying out: alas, ah, woe is me! what have I done?
Even so shall it come to pass with me: am not I
also a creature of God’s making, bearing his own
Image and similitude, into whom he hath breathed
the Spirit of life and immortality, unto whom he hath
made all things living subject: but woe is me, mine
haughty mind, proud aspiring stomach, and filthy
flesh, hath brought my soul into perpetual damnation;
yea, pride hath abused my understanding, in so much
that I have forgot my maker, the Spirit of God is
departed from me. I have promised the Devil my
Soul: and therefore it is but a folly for me to hope
for grace, but it must be even with me as with Lucifer,
thrown into perpetual burning fire: ah, woe is me
that ever I was born. In this perplexity lay this
miserable Doctor Faustus, having quite forgot his faith
in Christ, never falling to repentance truly, thereby
to attain the grace and holy Spirit of God again, the
which would have been able to have resisted the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>

strong assaults of Satan: for although he had made
him a promise, yet he might have remembered through
true repentance sinners come again into the favour
of God; which faith the faithful firmly hold, knowing
they that kill the body, are not able to hurt the soul:
but he was in all his opinions doubtful, without faith
or hope, and so he continued.</p>

<h3 id="HIST_CHAP_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<div class="center"><i>Another disputation betwixt Doctor Faustus and his
Spirit, of the power of the Devil, and of his
envy to mankind</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Doctor Faustus had a while pondered and
sorrowed with himself of his wretched estate, he called
again Mephostophiles unto him, commanding him to
tell him the judgment, rule, power, attempts, tyranny
and temptation of the Devil, and why he was moved
to such kind of living: whereupon the Spirit answered,
this question that thou demandest of me, will turn
thee to no small discontentment: therefore thou
shouldst not have desired me of such matters, for it
toucheth the secrets of our Kingdom, although I
cannot deny to resolve thy request. Therefore know
thou Faustus, that so soon as my Lord Lucifer fell
from heaven, he became a mortal enemy both to God
and man, and hath used (as now he doth) all manner
of tyranny to the destruction of man, as is manifest
by divers examples, one falling suddenly dead, another

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>

hangs himself, another drowns himself, others stab
themselves, others unfaithfully despair, and so come
to utter confusion: the first man Adam that was made
perfect to the similitude of God, was by my Lord his
policy, the whole decay of man: yea, Faustus, in him
was the beginning and first tyranny of my Lord
Lucifer used to man: the like did he with Cain, the
same with the children of Israel, when they worshipped
strange Gods, and fell to whoredom with strange
women: the like with Saul: so did he by the seven
husbands of her that after was the wife of Tobias:
likewise Dagon our fellow brought to destruction
thirty thousand men, whereupon the Ark of God was
stolen: and Belial made David to number his men,
whereupon were slain sixty thousand, also he deceived
King Solomon that worshipped the Gods of the
heathen: and there are such Spirits innumerable
that can come by men and tempt them, drive them to
sin, weaken their belief: for we rule the hearts of
Kings and Princes, stirring them up to war and bloodshed;
and to this intent do we spread ourselves
throughout all the world, as the utter enemies of God,
and his Son Christ, yea and all those that worship
them: and that thou knowest by thyself Faustus,
how we have dealt with thee. To this answered
Faustus, why then thou didst also beguile me. Yea
(quoth Mephostophiles) why should not we help thee
forwards: for so soon as we saw thy heart, how thou
didst despise thy degree taken in Divinity, and didst
study to search and know the secrets of our Kingdom;
even then did we enter into thee, giving thee divers
foul and filthy cogitations, pricking thee forward in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>

thine intent, and persuading thee that thou couldst
never attain to thy desire, until thou hast the help of
some Devil: and when thou wast delighted with this,
then took we root in thee; and so firmly, that thou
gavest thyself unto us, both body and soul the which
thou (Faustus) canst not deny. Hereat answered
Faustus, Thou sayest true Mephostophiles, I cannot
deny it: Ah, woe is me miserable Faustus; how have
I been deceived? had not I desired to know so much,
I had not been in this case: for having studied the
lives of the holy Saints and Prophets, and thereby
thought myself to understand sufficient in heavenly
matters, I thought myself not worthy to be called
Doctor Faustus, if I should not also know the secrets
of hell, and be associated with the furious Fiend
thereof; now therefore must I be rewarded accordingly.
Which speeches being uttered, Faustus went very
sorrowfully away from Mephostophiles.</p>

<h3 id="HIST_CHAP_XV">CHAPTER XV</h3>
<div class="center"><i>How Doctor Faustus desired again of his Spirit to
know the secrets and pains of hell; and whether
those damned Devils and their company might
ever come into the favour of God again or not?</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> was ever pondering with himself
how he might get loose from so damnable an end
as he had given himself unto, both of body and soul:
but his repentance was like to that of Cain and Judas,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>

he thought his sins greater than God could forgive,
hereupon rested his mind: he looked up to heaven,
but saw nothing therein; for his heart was so possessed
with the Devil, that he could think of nought
else but of hell, and the pains thereof. Wherefore in all
the haste he calleth unto him his Spirit Mephostophiles,
desiring him to tell him some more of the secrets of
hell, what pains the damned were in, and how they
were tormented, and whether the damned souls
might get again the favour of God, and so be released
out of their torments or not: whereupon the Spirit
answered, my Faustus, thou mayest well leave to
question any more of such matters, for they will but
disquiet thy mind, I pray thee what meanest thou?
Thinkest thou through these thy fantasies to escape us?
No, for if thou shouldst climb up to heaven, there to
hide thyself, yet would I thrust thee down again;
for thou art mine, and thou belongest unto our society:
therefore sweet Faustus, thou wilt repent this thy
foolish demand, except thou be content that I shall
tell thee nothing. Quoth Faustus ragingly, I will
know, or I will not live, wherefore dispatch and tell
me: to whom Mephostophiles answered, Faustus, it
is no trouble unto me at all to tell thee, and therefore
sith thou forcest me thereto, I will tell thee things
to the terror of thy soul, if thou wilt abide the hearing.
Thou wilt have me tell thee of the secrets of hell, and of
the pains thereof: know Faustus, that hell hath many
figures, semblances, and names, but it cannot be
named nor figured in such sort unto the living that
are damned, as it is unto those that are dead, and do
both see and feel the torments thereof: for hell is

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span>

said to be deadly, out of the which came never any to
life again but one, but he is as nothing for thee to reckon
upon, hell is bloodthirsty, and is never satisfied; hell
is a valley, into the which the damned souls fall:
for so soon as the soul is out of man’s body, it would
gladly go to the place from whence it came, and
climbeth up above the highest hills, even to the heavens;
where being by the Angels of the first Mobile denied
entertainment (in consideration of their evil life spent
on the earth) they fall into the deepest pit or valley
which hath no bottom, into a perpetual fire, which
shall never be quenched: for like as the Flint thrown
into the water, loseth not his virtue, neither is his
fire extinguished; even so the hellish fire is unquenchable:
and even as the Flint stone in the fire being
burned is red hot, and yet consumeth not: so likewise
the damned souls in our hellish fire are ever burning,
but their pains never diminishing. Therefore is hell
called the everlasting pain, in which is neither hope
nor mercy: So is it called utter darkness, in which
we see neither the light of Sun, Moon, nor Star:
and were our darkness like the darkness of the night,
yet were there hope of mercy, but ours is perpetual
darkness, clean exempt from the face of God. Hell
hath also a place within it called Chasma, out of the
which issueth all manner of thunders, lightnings, with
such horrible shriekings and wailings, that oft-times
the very Devils themselves stand in fear thereof: for
one while it sendeth forth winds with exceeding snow,
hail, and rain congealing the water into ice; with
the which the damned are frozen, gnash their teeth,
howl and cry, and yet cannot die. Otherwhiles, it

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>

sendeth forth most horrible hot mists or fogs, with
flashing flames of fire and brimstone, wherein the
sorrowful souls of the damned lie broiling in their
reiterated torments: yea Faustus, hell is called a
prison wherein the damned lie continually bound;
it is also called Pernicies, and Exitium, death, destruction,
hurtfulness, mischief, a mischance, a pitiful
and an evil thing, world without end. We have also
with us in hell a ladder, reaching of an exceeding height,
as though it would touch the heavens, on which the
damned ascend to seek the blessing of God; but
through their infidelity, when they are at the very
highest degree, they fall down again into their former
miseries, complaining of the heat of that unquenchable
fire: yea sweet Faustus, so must thou understand
of hell, the while thou art so desirous to know the
secrets of our Kingdom. And mark Faustus, hell is
the nurse of death, the heat of all fire, the shadow of
heaven and earth, the oblivion of all goodness, the
pains unspeakable, the griefs unremovable, the dwelling
of Devils, Dragons, Serpents, Adders, Toads,
Crocodiles, and all manner of venomous creatures, the
puddle of sin, the stinking fog ascending from the
Stygian lake, Brimstone, Pitch, and all manner of
unclean metals, the perpetual and unquenchable fire,
the end of whose miseries was never purposed by God:
yea, yea Faustus, thou sayest, I shall, I must, nay I
will tell thee the secrets of our Kingdom, for thou
buyest it dearly, and thou must and shalt be partaker
of our torments, that (as the Lord God said) never
shall cease: for hell, the woman’s belly, and the earth
are never satisfied; there shalt thou abide horrible

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span>

torments, trembling, gnashing of teeth, howling,
crying, burning, freezing, melting, swimming in a
labyrinth of miseries, scalding, burning, smoking in
thine eyes, stinking in thy nose, hoarseness of thy
speech, deafness of thine ears, trembling of thy hands,
biting thine own tongue with pain, thy heart crushed
as in a press, thy bones broken, the Devils tossing firebrands
upon thee, yea thy whole carcass tossed upon
muck-forks from one Devil to another, yea Faustus,
then wilt thou wish for death, and he will fly from
thee, thine unspeakable torments shall be every day
augmented more and more, for the greater the sin,
the greater is the punishment: how likest thou this,
my Faustus, a resolution answerable to thy request?</p>

<p>Lastly, thou wilt have me tell thee that which
belongeth only to God, which is, if it be possible for
the damned to come again into the favour of God,
or not: why Faustus, thou knowest that this is against
thy promise, for what shouldst thou desire to know
that, having already given thy soul to the Devil to
have the pleasure of this world, and to know the
secrets of hell? therefore art thou damned, and how
canst thou then come again to the favour of God?
Wherefore I directly answer, no; for whomsoever
God hath forsaken and thrown into hell, must there
abide his wrath and indignation in that unquenchable
fire, where is no hope nor mercy to be looked for,
but abiding in perpetual pains world without end:
for even as much it availeth thee Faustus, to hope
for the favour of God again, as Lucifer himself, who
indeed although he and we all have a hope, yet is it
to small avail, and taketh none effect, for out of that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span>

place God will neither hear crying nor sighing; if he
do, thou shalt have as little remorse, as Dives, Cain,
or Judas had: what helpeth the Emperor, King,
Prince, Duke, Earl, Baron, Lord, Knight, Squire or
Gentleman, to cry for mercy being there? Nothing:
for if on the earth they would not be Tyrants, and self-willed,
rich with covetousness; proud with pomp,
gluttons, drunkards, whoremongers, backbiters, robbers,
murderers, blasphemers, and such-like, then
were there some hope to be looked for: therefore my
Faustus, as thou comest to hell with these qualities,
thou must say with Cain, My sins are greater than can
be forgiven, go hang thyself with Judas: and lastly,
be content to suffer torments with Dives. Therefore
know Faustus, that the damned have neither end nor
time appointed in the which they may hope to be
released, for if there were any such hope, that they
but by throwing one drop of water out of the Sea in
a day, until it were all dry: or if there were an heap
of sand as high as from the earth to the heavens, that
a bird carrying away but one corn in a day, at the end
of this so long labour; that yet they might hope at
the last, God would have mercy on them, they would
be comforted: but now there is no hope that God once
thinks upon them, or that their howlings shall never be
heard; yea, so impossible, as it is for thee to hide thyself
from God, or impossible for thee to remove the
mountains, or to empty the sea, or to tell the number
of the drops of rain that have fallen from Heaven
until this day, or to tell what there is most of in the
world, yea and for a Camel to go through the eye of
a needle: even so impossible it is for thee Faustus,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>

and the rest of the damned, to come again into the
favour of God. And thus Faustus hast thou heard
my last sentence, and I pray thee how dost thou like
it? But know this, that I counsel thee to let me be
unmolested hereafter with such disputations, or else
I will vex thee every limb, to thy small contentment.
Doctor Faustus departed from his Spirit very pensive
and sorrowful, laid him on his bed, altogether doubtful
of the grace and favour of God, wherefore he fell into
fantastical cogitations: fain he would have had his
soul at liberty again, but the Devil had so blinded
him, and taken such deep root in his heart, that he
could never think to crave God’s mercy, or if by
chance he had any good motion, straightways the Devil
would thrust him a fair Lady into his chamber, which
fell to kissing and dalliance with him, through which
means, he threw his godly motions in the wind, going
forward still in his wicked practices, to the utter ruin
both of his body and soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span>, being yet desirous to hear more
strange things, called his Spirit unto him, saying:
My Mephostophiles, I have yet another suit unto
thee, which I pray thee deny not to resolve me of.
Faustus (quoth the Spirit) I am loth to reason with

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>

thee any further, for thou art never satisfied in thy
mind, but always bringest me a new. Yet I pray thee
this once (quoth Faustus) do me so much favour, as
to tell me the truth in this matter, and hereafter I will
be no more so earnest with thee. The Spirit was
altogether against it, but yet once more he would
abide him: well (said the Spirit to Faustus), what
demandest thou of me? Faustus said, I would gladly
know of thee, if thou wert a man in manner and form
as I am; what wouldest thou do to please both God
and man? Whereat the Spirit smiled saying: my
Faustus, if I were a man as thou art, and that God had
adorned me with those gifts of nature as thou once
haddest; even so long as the breath of God were by,
and within me, would I humble myself unto his
Majesty, endeavouring in all that I could to keep his
Commandments, praise him, glorify him, that I might
continue in his favour, so were I sure to enjoy the
eternal joy and felicity of his Kingdom. Faustus said,
but that have not I done. No, thou sayest true (quoth
Mephostophiles) thou hast not done it, but thou hast
denied thy Lord and maker, which gave thee the
breath of life, speech, hearing, sight, and all other thy
reasonable senses that thou mightest understand his
will and pleasure, to live to the glory and honour of
his name, and to the advancement of thy body and
soul, him I say being thy maker hast thou denied and
defied, yea wickedly thou hast applied that excellent
gift of thine understanding, and given thy soul to the
Devil: therefore give none the blame but thine own
self-will, thy proud and aspiring mind, which hath
brought thee into the wrath of God and utter damnation.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span>

This is most true (quoth Faustus), but tell
me Mephostophiles, wouldst thou be in my case as I
am now? Yea, saith the Spirit (and with that fetched
a great sigh) for yet would I so humble myself, that
I would win the favour of God. Then (said Doctor
Faustus) it were time enough for me if I amended.
True (said Mephostophiles), if it were not for thy
great sins, which are so odious and detestable in the
sight of God, that it is too late for thee, for the wrath
of God resteth upon thee. Leave off (quoth Faustus)
and tell me my question to my greater comfort.</p>

to be resolved any more in such-like questions propounded;
forgot all good works, and fell to be a
Calendar maker by help of his Spirit; and also in

he had learned so perfectly of his Spirit the course
of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, that he had the most
famous name of all the Mathematicks<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> that lived in

to presage of matters to come, which have come to

Calendars, and Almanacs making, for when he presaged
upon any change, Operation, or alteration of the
weather, or Elements; as wind, rain, fogs, snow, hail,
moist, dry, warm, cold, thunder, lightning: it fell so
duly out, as if an Angel of heaven had forewarned it.
He did not like the unskilful Astronomers of our time,
that set in Winter cold, moist, airy, frosty; and in the
Dog-days, hot, dry, thunder, fire, and such-like: but
he set in all his works, day and hour, when, where,

vary and very much to disagree: wherefore I pray thee
to teach me the truth in this matter. To whom his
Spirit answered, Faustus, thou shalt know that the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>

practitioners or speculators, or at least the first inventors
of these Arts, have done nothing of themselves
certain, whereupon thou mayest attain to the true
prognosticating or presaging of things concerning
the heavens, or of the influence of the Planets: for if
by chance some one Mathematician or Astronomer
hath left behind him anything worthy of memory:
they have so blinded it with Enigmatical words, blind
Characters, and such obscure figures; that it is impossible
for an earthly man to attain unto the knowledge
thereof, without the aid of some Spirit, or else the
special gift of God; for such are the hidden works of
God from men: yet do we Spirits that fly and fleet
in all Elements, know such, and there is nothing to
be done, or by the Heavens pretended, but we know
it, except only the day of Doom. Wherefore (Faustus)
learn of me, I will teach thee the course and recourse
of ♄. ♃. ♂. ☉. ♀. ☿ and ☽.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the cause of winter and
summer, the exaltation and declination of the Sun, the
eclipse of the Moon, the distance and height of the
Poles, and every fixed Star, the nature and operation
of the elements, fire, air, water, and earth, and all
that is contained in them, yea herein there is nothing
hidden from me, but only the fifth essence, which
once thou hadst Faustus at liberty, but now Faustus
thou hast lost it past recovery; wherefore leaving that
which will not be again had, learn now of me to make
thunder, lightning, hail, snow, and rain: the clouds
to rend, the earth and craggy rocks to shake and split in
sunder, the Seas to swell, and roar, and over-run their

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>

marks. Knowest not thou that the deeper the Sun
shines, the hotter he pierces? so, the more thy Art is
famous whilst thou art here, the greater shall be thy
name when thou art gone. Knowest not thou that the
earth is frozen cold and dry; the water running, cold
and moist; the air flying, hot and moist; the fire
consuming, hot and dry? Yea Faustus, so must thy
heart be enflamed like the fire to mount on high:
learn, Faustus, to fly like myself, as swift as thought
from one kingdom to another, to sit at princes’ tables,
to eat their daintiest fare, to have thy pleasure of their
fair Ladies, wives and concubines, to use their jewels,
and costly robes as things belonging to thee, and not
unto them: learn of me, Faustus, to run through
walls, doors, and gates of stone and iron, to creep
into the earth like a worm, to swim in the water like
a fish, to fly in the air like a bird, and to live and nourish
thyself in the fire like a Salamander; so shalt thou be
famous, renowned, far-spoken of, and extolled for
thy skill: going on knives, not hurting thy feet;
carrying fire in thy bosom, and not burning thy shirt;
seeing through the heavens as through a Crystal,
wherein is placed the Planets, with all the rest of the
presaging Comets, the whole circuit of the world from
the East to the West, North and South: there shalt thou
know, Faustus, wherefore the fiery sphere above ♄ and
the signs of the Zodiac doth not burn and consume the
whole face of the earth, being hindered by placing
the two moist elements between them, the airy clouds
and the wavering waves of water: yea, Faustus, I will
learn thee the secrets of nature, what the causes that
the Sun in summer being at the highest, giveth all

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>

his heat downwards on the earth; and being in winter
at the lowest, giveth all his heat upward into the
heavens: that the snow should be of so great virtue,
as the honey; and the Lady Saturnia ♓ <a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> in Occulto
more hotter than the Sun in Manifesto. Come on
my Faustus, I will make thee as perfect in these things
as myself, I will learn thee to go invisible, to find out
the mines of gold and silver, the fodines<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of precious
stones, as the Carbuncle, the Diamond, Sapphire,
Emerald, Ruby, Topaz, Jacinth, Garnet, Jasper,
Amethyst, use all these at thy pleasure, take thy heart’s
desire: thy time Faustus weareth away, then why
wilt thou not take thy pleasure of the world? Come up,
we will go visit Kings at their own courts, and at their
most sumptuous banquets be their guests, if willingly
they invite us not, then perforce we will serve our own
turn with their best meat and daintiest wine: Agreed,
quoth Faustus; but let me pause a while upon this
thou hast even now declared unto me.</p>

<div class="center"><i>How Doctor Faustus fell into despair with himself:
for having put forth a question unto his Spirit,
they fell at variance, whereupon the whole
route of Devils appeared unto him, threatening
him sharply</i>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> revolving with himself the speeches
of his Spirit, he became so woeful and sorrowful in
his cogitations, that he thought himself already frying
in the hottest flames of hell, and lying in his muse,
suddenly there appeared unto him his Spirit, demanding
what thing so grieved and troubled his conscience,
whereat Doctor Faustus gave no answer: yet the
Spirit very earnestly lay upon him to know the cause;
and if it were possible, he would find remedy for his
grief, and ease him of his sorrows. To whom Faustus
answered, I have taken thee unto me as a servant to
do me service, and thy service will be very dear unto
me; yet I cannot have any diligence of thee farther
than thou list thyself, neither dost thou in anything
as it becometh thee. The Spirit replied, my Faustus,
thou knowest that I was never against thy commandments
as yet, but ready to serve and resolve thy questions,
although I am not bound unto thee in such
respects as concern the hurt of our Kingdom, yet was
I always willing to answer thee, and so I am still:
therefore my Faustus say on boldly, what is thy will
and pleasure? At which words, the Spirit stole away
the heart of Faustus, who spake in this sort, Mephostophiles,
tell me how and after what sort God made the
world, and all the creatures in them, and why man
was made after the Image of God?</p>

<p>The Spirit hearing this, answered, Faustus thou
knowest that all this is in vain for thee to ask, I know
that thou art sorry for that thou hast done, but it
availeth thee not, for I will tear thee in thousands of
pieces, if thou change not thine opinions, and hereat
he vanished away. Whereat Faustus all sorrowful
for that he had put forth such a question, fell to weeping
and to howling bitterly, not for his sins towards

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>

God, but for that the Devil was departed from him so
suddenly, and in such a rage. And being in this
perplexity, he was suddenly taken in such an extreme
cold, as if he should have frozen in the place where he
sat, in which, the greatest Devil in hell appeared unto
him, with certain of his hideous and infernal company
in the most ugliest shapes that it was possible to think
upon, and traversing the chamber round about where
Faustus sat, Faustus thought to himself, now are they
come for me though my time be not come, and that
because I have asked such questions of my servant
Mephostophiles: at whose cogitations, the chiefest
Devil which was his Lord, unto whom he gave his
soul, that was Lucifer, spake in this sort: Faustus, I
have seen thy thoughts, which are not as thou hast
vowed unto me, by virtue of this letter, and shewed
him the Obligation that he had written with his own
blood, wherefore I am come to visit thee and to shew
thee some of our hellish pastimes, in hope that will
draw and confirm thy mind a little more stedfast unto
us. Content quoth Faustus, go to, let me see what
pastime you can make. At which words, the great
Devil in his likeness sat him down by Faustus, commanding
the rest of the Devils to appear in their form,
as if they were in hell: first entered Belial in form of
a Bear, with curled black hair to the ground, his ears
standing upright: within the ear was as red as blood,
out of which issued flames of fire, his teeth were a foot
at least long, as white as snow, with a tail three ells
long (at the least) having two wings, one behind each
arm, and thus one after another they appeared to
Faustus in form as they were in hell. Lucifer himself

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>

sat in manner of a man, all hairy, but of a brown colour
like a Squirrel, curled, and his tail turning upwards
on his back as the Squirrels use, I think he could
crack nuts too like a Squirrel. After him came
Beelzebub in curled hair of horse-flesh colour, his head
like the head of a Bull, with a mighty pair of horns,
and two long ears down to the ground, and two wings
on his back, with pricking stings like thorns: out of
his wings issued flames of fire, his tail was like a Cow.
Then came Astaroth in form of a worm, going upright
on his tail; he had no feet, but a tail like a slow-worm:
under his chaps grew two short hands, and his back
was coal-black, his belly thick in the middle, and yellow
like gold, having many bristles on his back like a Hedgehog.
After him came Chamagosta, being white and
gray mixed, exceeding curled and hairy: he had a head
like the head of an Ass, the tail like a Cat, and Claws
like an Ox, lacking nothing of an ell broad. Then
came Anobis; this Devil had a head like a Dog, white
and black hair in shape of a Hog, saving that he had
but two feet, one under his throat, the other at his
tail: he was four ells long, with hanging ears like a
Bloodhound. After him came Dythycan, he was a
short thief in form of a Pheasant, with shining
feathers, and four feet: his neck was green, his body
red, and his feet black. The last was called Brachus,
with four short feet like an Hedgehog, yellow and
green: the upper side of his body was brown, and the
belly like blue flames of fire; the tail red, like the tail
of a Monkey. The rest of the Devils were in form of
insensible beasts, as Swine, Harts, Bears, Wolves,
Apes, Buffs, Goats, Antelopes, Elephants, Dragons,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>

Horses, Asses, Lions, Cats, Snakes, Toads, and all
manner of ugly odious Serpents and Worms: yet
came in such sort, that every one at his entry into the
Hall, made their reverence unto Lucifer, and so took
their places, standing in order as they came, until
they had filled the whole Hall: wherewith suddenly
fell a most horrible thunder-clap, that the house shook
as though it would have fallen to the ground, upon
which every monster had a muck-fork in his hand,
holding them towards Faustus as though they would
have run a tilt at him: which when Faustus perceived,
he thought upon the words of Mephostophiles, when
he told him how the souls in hell were tormented,
being cast from Devil to Devil upon muck-forks, he
thought verily to have been tormented there of them
in like sort. But Lucifer perceiving his thought, spake
to him, my Faustus, how likest thou this crew of mine?
Quoth Faustus, why came you not in another manner
of shape? Lucifer replied, we cannot change our
hellish form, we have shewed ourselves here, as we
are there; yet can we blind men’s eyes in such sort,
that when we will we repair unto them, as if we were
men or Angels of light, although our dwelling be in
darkness. Then said Faustus, I like not so many of
you together, whereupon Lucifer commanded them
to depart, except seven of the principal, forthwith
they presently vanished, which Faustus perceiving,
he was somewhat better comforted, and spake to
Lucifer, where is my servant Mephostophiles, let me
see if he can do the like, whereupon came a fierce
Dragon, flying and spitting fire round about the house,
and coming towards Lucifer, made reverence, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>

then changed himself to the form of a Friar, saying,
Faustus, what wilt thou? Saith Faustus, I will that
thou teach me to transform myself in like sort as
thou and the rest have done: then Lucifer put forth
his Paw, and gave Faustus a book, saying hold, do
what thou wilt, which he looking upon, straightways
changed himself into a Hog, then into a Worm, then
into a Dragon, and finding this for his purpose, it
liked him well. Quoth he to Lucifer, and how cometh
it that all these filthy forms are in the world? Lucifer
answered, they are ordained of God as plagues unto
men, and so shalt thou be plagued (quoth he) whereupon,
came Scorpions, Wasps, Emmets, Bees, and
Gnats, which fell to stinging and biting him, and
all the whole house was filled with a most horrible
stinking fog, in so much, that Faustus saw nothing,
but still was tormented; wherefore he cried for help
saying, Mephostophiles my faithful servant, where
art thou, help, help, I pray thee: hereat his Spirit
answered nothing, but Lucifer himself said, ho ho ho
Faustus, how likest thou the creation of the world,
and incontinent it was clear again, and the Devils and
all the filthy Cattle were vanished, only Faustus was
left alone; seeing nothing, but hearing the sweetest
music that ever he heard before, at which he was so
ravished with delight, that he forgot the fears he was
in before: and it repented him that he had seen no
more of their pastime.</p>

<h3 id="HIST_CHAP_XX">CHAPTER XX</h3>
<div class="center"><i>How Doctor Faustus desired to see hell, and of the
manner how he was used therein</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> bethinking how his time went away,
and how he had spent eight years thereof, he meant
to spend the rest to his better contentment, intending
quite to forget any such motions as might offend the
Devil any more: wherefore on a time he called his
Spirit Mephostophiles, and said unto him, bring thou
hither unto me thy Lord Lucifer, or Belial: he brought
him (notwithstanding) one that was called Beelzebub,
the which asked Faustus his pleasure. Quoth Faustus,
I would know of thee if I may see hell and take a view
thereof? That thou shalt (said the Devil) and at midnight
I will fetch thee. Well, night being come,
Doctor Faustus awaited very diligently for the coming
of the Devil to fetch him, and thinking that he carried
all too long, he went to the window, where he pulled
open a casement, and looking into the Element, he
saw a cloud in the North more black, dark, and obscure,
than all the rest of the Sky, from whence the wind
blew most horrible right into Faustus his chamber,
filled the whole house with smoke, that Faustus was
almost smothered: hereat fell an exceeding thunder-clap,
and withal came a great rugged black Bear, all
curled, and upon his back a chair of beaten gold, and
spake to Faustus, saying, sit up and away with me:
and Doctor Faustus that had so long abode the smoke,
wished rather to be in hell than there, got on the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>

Devil, and so they went together. But mark how
the Devil blinded him, and made him believe that
he carried him into hell, for he carried him into the
air, where Faustus fell into a sound sleep, as if he had
sat in a warm water or bath: at last they came to
a place which burneth continually with flashing flames
of fire and brimstone, whereout issued an exceeding
mighty clap of thunder, with so horrible a noise, that
Faustus awaked, but the Devil went forth on his way
and carried Faustus thereinto, yet notwithstanding,
howsoever it burnt, Doctor Faustus felt no more heat,
than as it were the glimpse of the Sun in May: there
heard he all manner of music to welcome him, but
saw none playing on them; it pleased him well, but
he durst not ask, for he was forbidden it before. To
meet the Devil and the guest that came with him,
came three other ugly Devils, the which ran back
again before the Bear to make them way, against whom
there came running an exceeding great Hart, which
would have thrust Faustus out of his chair, but being
defended by the other three Devils, the Hart was put

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span>

to the repulse: thence going on their way Faustus
looked, and behold there was nothing but Snakes, and
all manner of venomous beasts about him, which were
exceeding great, unto the which Snakes came many
Storks, and swallowed up all the whole multitude of
Snakes, that they left not one: which when Faustus
saw, he marvelled greatly: but proceeding further
on their hellish voyage, there came forth of a hollow
cliff an exceeding great flying Bull, the which with such
a force hit Faustus his chair with his head and horns,
that he turned Faustus and his Bear over and over,
so that the Bear vanished away, whereat Faustus began
to cry: oh, woe is me that ever I came here: for he
thought there to have been beguiled of the Devil, and
to make his end before his time appointed or conditioned
of the Devil: but shortly came unto him a monstrous
Ape, bidding Faustus be of good cheer, and said,
get upon me; all the fire in hell seemed to Faustus
to have been put out, whereupon followed a monstrous
thick fog, that he saw nothing, but shortly it seemed
to him to wax clear, where he saw two great Dragons
fastened to a waggon, into the which the Ape ascended
and set Faustus therein; forth flew the Dragons into
an exceeding dark cloud, where Faustus saw neither
Dragon nor Chariot wherein he sat, and such were the
cries of tormented souls, with mighty thunder-claps
and flashing lightnings about his ears, that poor
Faustus shook for fear. Upon this came they to a water,
stinking and filthy, thick like mud, into the which ran
the Dragons, sinking under with waggon and all; but
Faustus felt no water but as it were a small mist,
saving that the waves beat so sore upon him, that he

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>

saw nothing under and over him but only water, in the
which he lost his Dragons, Ape, and waggon; and
sinking yet deeper and deeper, he came at last as it
were upon an high Rock, where the waters parted and
left him thereon: but when the water was gone, it
seemed to him he should there have ended his life, for
he saw no way but death: the Rock was as high from
the bottom as Heaven is from the earth: there sat
he, seeing nor hearing any man, and looked ever upon
the Rock; at length he saw a little hole, out of the
which issued fire; thought he, how shall I now do? I
am forsaken of the Devils, and they that brought me
hither, here must I either fall to the bottom, or burn
in the fire, or sit still in despair: with that in his madness
he gave a leap into the fiery hole, saying: hold
you infernal Hags, take here this sacrifice as my last
end; the which I justly have deserved: upon this
he was entered, and finding himself as yet unburned
or touched of the fire, he was the better appayed,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> but
there was so great a noise as he never heard the like
before, it passed all the thunder that ever he had
heard; and coming down further to the bottom of
the Rock, he saw a fire, wherein were many worthy
and noble personages, as Emperors, Kings, Dukes,
and Lords, and many thousands more of tormented
souls, at the edge of which fire ran a most pleasant,
clear, and cool water to behold, into the which many
tormented souls sprang out of the fire to cool themselves;
but being so freezing cold, they were constrained
to return again into the fire, and thus wearied
themselves and spent their endless torments out of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span>

one labyrinth into another, one while in heat, another
while in cold: but Faustus standing thus all this while
gazing on them were thus tormented, he saw one
leaping out of the fire and screeching horribly, whom
he thought to have known, wherefore he would fain
have spoken unto him, but remembering that he was
forbidden, he refrained speaking. Then this Devil
that brought him in, came to him again in likeness of
a Bear, with the chair on his back, and bade him sit
up, for it was time to depart: so Faustus got up, and
the Devil carried him out into the air, where he had so
sweet music that he fell asleep by the way. His boy
Christopher being all this while at home, and missing
his master so long, thought his master would have
tarried and dwelt with the Devil for ever: but whilst
his boy was in these cogitations, his master came home,
for the Devil brought him home fast asleep as he sat
in his chair, and so he threw him on his bed, where
(being thus left of the Devil) he lay until day. When
he awaked, he was amazed, like a man that had been
in a dark dungeon; musing with himself if it were
true or false that he had seen hell, or whether he was
blinded or not: but he rather persuaded himself
that he had been there than otherwise, because he had
seen such wonderful things: wherefore he most
carefully took pen and ink, and wrote those things
in order as he had seen: the which writing was afterwards
found by his boy in his study; which afterwards
was published to the whole city of Wittenberg
in open print, for example to all Christians.</p>

<div class="center"><i>How Doctor Faustus was carried through the air
up to the heavens to see the world, and how the
Sky and Planets ruled: after the which he wrote
one letter to his friend of the same to Liptzig,
how he went about the world in eight days</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> letter was found by a freeman and
Citizen of Wittenberg, written with his own hand, and sent to his
friend at Liptzig a Physician, named John Victor, the contents of which
were as followeth.</p>

<p>Amongst other things (my loving friend and brother)
I remember yet the former friendship had together,
when we were schoolfellows and students in the
University at Wittenberg, whereas you first studied
Physic, Astronomy, Astrology, Geometry, and Cosmography;
I to the contrary (you know) studied Divinity:
notwithstanding now in any of your own studies I am
seen (I am persuaded) further then your self: for
sithence I began I have never erred, for (might I speak
it without affecting my own praise) my Calendars and
other practices have not only the commendations of
the common sort, but also of the chiefest Lords and
Nobles of this our Dutch Nation: because (which is
chiefly to be noted) I write and presaged of matters
to come, which all accord and fall out so right, as if
they had been already seen before. And for that (my
beloved Victori) you write to know my voyage which
I made into the Heavens, the which (as you certify me
you have had some suspicion of, although you partly

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>

persuaded yourself, that it is a thing impossible) no
matter for that, it is as it is, and let it be as it will,
once it was done, in such manner as now according
unto your request I give you here to understand.</p>

<p>I being once laid on my bed, and could not sleep
for thinking on my Calendar and practice, I marvelled
with myself how it were possible that the Firmament
should be known and so largely written of men, or
whether they write true or false, by their own opinions,
or supposition, or by due observations and true course
of the heavens. Behold, being in these my muses,
suddenly I heard a great noise, in so much that I
thought my house would have been blown down, so
that all my doors and chests flew open, whereat I was
not a little astonied, for withal I heard a groaning
voice which said, get up, the desire of thy heart, mind,
and thought shalt thou see: at the which I answered,
what my heart desireth, that would I fain see, and to
make proof, if I shall see I will away with thee. Why
then (quoth he) look out at thy window, there cometh
a messenger for thee, that did I, and behold, there
stood a Waggon, with two Dragons before it to draw
the same, and all the Waggon was of a light burning fire,
and for that the Moon shone, I was the willinger at
that time to depart: but the voice spake again, sit up
and let us away: I will, said I, go with thee, but upon
this condition, that I may ask after all things that I see,
hear, or think on: the voice answered, I am content
for this time. Hereupon I got me into the Waggon,
so that the Dragons carried me upright into the air.
The Waggon had also four wheels the which rattled
so, and made such a noise as if we had been all this

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>

while running on the stones: and round about us flew
out flames of fire, and the higher that I came, the more
the earth seemed to be darkened, so that methought I
came out of a dungeon, and looking down from Heaven,
behold, Mephostophiles my Spirit and servant was
behind me, and when he perceived that I saw him,
he came and sat by me, to whom I said, I pray thee
Mephostophiles whither shall I go now? Let not
that trouble thy mind, said he, and yet they carried us
higher up. And now will I tell thee good friend and
schoolfellow, what things I have seen and proved;
for on the Tuesday went I out, and on Tuesday seven-nights
following I came home again, that is, eight days,
in which time I slept not, no not one wink came in
mine eyes, and we went invisible of any man: and as
the day began to appear, after our first night’s journey,
I said to my Spirit Mephostophiles, I pray thee how
far have we now ridden, I am sure thou knowest:
for methinks that we are ridden exceeding far, the
World seemeth so little: Mephostophiles answered me,
my Faustus believe me, that from the place from whence
thou earnest, unto this place where we are now, is already
forty-seven leagues right in height, and as the day
increased, I looked down upon the World, there saw
I many kingdoms and provinces, likewise the whole
world, Asia, Europa, and Africa, I had a sight of:
and being so high, quoth I to my Spirit, tell me now
how these Kingdoms lie, and what they are called, the
which he denied not, saying, see this on our left hand
is Hungaria, this is also Prussia on our left hand, and
Poland, Muscovia, Tartascelesia,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Bohemia, Saxony;:

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>

and here on our right hand, Spain, Portugal, France,
England, and Scotland: then right out before us lie
the Kingdoms of Persia, India, Arabia, the King of
Alchar, and the great Cham: now are we come to
Wittenberg, and are right over the town of Weim in
Austria, and ere long will we be at Constantinople,
Tripolie, and Jerusalem, and after will we pierce the
frozen Zone, and shortly touch the Horizon, and the
Zenith of Wittenberg. There looked I on the Ocean
Sea, and beheld a great many of ships and Galleys
ready to the battle, one against another: and thus I
spent my journey, now cast I my eyes here, now there,
toward South, North, East, and West, I have been in
one place where it rained and hailed, and in another
where the Sun shone excellent fair, and so I think
that I saw the most things in and about the world,
with great admiration that in one place it rained, and
in another hail and snow, on this side the Sun shone
bright, some hills covered with snow never consuming,
others were so hot that grass and trees were burned
and consumed therewith. Then looked I up to the
heavens, and behold, they went so swift, that I thought
they would have sprung in thousands. Likewise it was
so clear and so hot, that I could not long gaze into it,
it so dimmed my sight: and had not my Spirit
Mephostophiles covered me as it were with a shadowing
cloud, I had been burnt with the extreme heat
thereof, for the Sky the which we behold here when
we look up from the earth, is so fast and thick as a
wall, clear and shining bright as a Crystal, in the which
is placed the Sun, which casteth forth his rays or
beams over the universal world, to the uttermost

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span>

confines of the earth. But we think that the Sun is
very little: no, it is altogether as big as the world.
Indeed the body substantial is but little in compass,
but the rays or stream that it casteth forth, by reason
of the thing wherein it is placed, maketh him to extend
and shew himself over the whole world: and we think
that the Sun runneth his course, and that the heavens
stand still: no, it is the heavens that move his course,
and the Sun abideth perpetually in his place,
he is permanent, and fixed in his place, and although
we see him beginning to ascend in the Orient or East,
at the highest in the Meridian or South, setting in the
Occident or West, yet is he at the lowest in Septentrio
or North, and yet he moveth not. It is the axle of the
heavens that moveth the whole firmament, being a
Chaos or confused thing, and for that proof, I will
shew thee this example, like as thou seest a bubble
made of water and soap blown forth of a quill, is in
form of a confused mass or Chaos, and being in this
form, is moved at pleasure of the wind, which runneth
round about that Chaos, and moveth him also round:
even so is the whole firmament or Chaos, wherein are
placed the sun, and the rest of the Planets turned
and carried at the pleasure of the Spirit of God, which
is wind. Yea Christian Reader, to the glory of God,
and for the profit of thy soul, I will open unto thee
the divine opinion touching the ruling of this confused
Chaos, far more than any rude German Author, being
possessed with the Devil, was able to utter; and to
prove some of my sentence before to be true, look
into Genesis unto the works of God, at the creation
of the world, there shalt thou find, that the Spirit of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>

God moved upon the waters before heaven and earth
were made. Mark how he made it, and how by his
word every element took his place: these were not
his works, but his words; for all the words he used
before, he concluded afterwards in one work, which
was in making man: mark reader with patience for
thy soul’s health, see into all that was done by the word
and work of God, light and darkness was, the firmament
stood, and their great ☉ and little light ☽ in
it: the moist waters were in one place, the earth was
dry, and every element brought forth according to
the word of God: now followeth his works he made
man like his own image, how? out of the earth?
The earth will shape no image without water, there
was one of the elements. But all this while where
was wind? all elements were at the word of God,
man was made, and in a form by the work of God, yet
moved not that work, before God breathed the Spirit
of life into his nostrils, and made him a living soul,
here was the first wind and Spirit of God out of his
own mouth, which we have likewise from the same
seed which was only planted by God in Adam, which
wind, breath, or spirit, when he had received, he was
living and moving on earth, for it was ordained of
God for his habitation, but the heavens are the habitation
of the Lord: and like as I shewed before of the
bubble or confused Chaos made of water and soap,
through the wind and breath of man is turned round,
and carried with every wind; even so the firmament
wherein the Sun and the rest of the Planets are fixed,
moved, turned, and carried with the wind, breath, or
Spirit of God, for the heavens and firmament are

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>

movable as the Chaos, but the Sun is fixed in the firmament.
And farther my good schoolfellow, I was thus
nigh the heavens, where methought every Planet was
but as half the earth, and under the firmament ruled
the Spirits in the air, and as I came down I looked upon
the world and the heavens, and methought that the
earth was enclosed in comparison within the firmament,
as the yolk of an egg within the white, and methought
that the whole length of the earth was not a span long,
and the water was as if it had been twice as broad and
long as the earth, even thus at the eight days end came
I home again, and fell asleep, and so I continued
sleeping three days and three nights together: and
the first hour that I waked, I fell fresh again to my
Calendar, and have made them in right ample manner
as you know, and to satisfy your request, for that you
writ unto me, I have in consideration of our old friendship
had at the University of Wittenberg, declared
unto you my heavenly voyage, wishing no worse unto
you, than unto myself, that is, that your mind were as
mine in all respects. Dixi.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> having over-run fifteen years of his
appointed time, he took upon him a journey, with full
pretence to see the whole world: and calling his
spirit Mephostophiles unto him, he said: thou knowest
that thou art bound unto me upon conditions, to perform
and fulfil my desire in all things, wherefore my
pretence is to visit the whole face of the earth visible
and invisible when it pleaseth me: wherefore, I
enjoin and command thee to the same. Whereupon
Mephostophiles answered, I am ready my Lord at
thy command and forthwith the Spirit changed himself
unto the likeness of a flying horse, saying, Faustus
sit up, I am ready. Doctor Faustus loftily sat upon
him, and forward they went: Faustus came through
many a land and Province; as Pannonia, Austria,
Germania, Bohemia, Slesia, Saxony, Missene, During,
Francklandt, Shawblandt, Beyerlandt, Stiria, Carinthia,
Poland, Litaw, Liefland, Prussia, Denmarke,
Muscovia, Tartaria, Turkie, Persia, Cathai, Alexandria,
Barbaria, Ginnie, Peru, the straits of Magelanes,
India, all about the frozen Zone, and Terra Incognita,
Nova Hispaniola, the Isles of Terzera, Mederi, S.
Michael’s, the Canaries, and the Tenorrifocie, into
Spaine, the Mayne Land, Portugall, Italie, Campania,
the Kingdom of Naples, the Isles of Sicilia, Malta,
Majoria, Minoria, to the Knights of the Rhodes,
Candie, or Creete, Ciprus, Corinth, Switzerland,
France, Freesland, Westphalia, Zeland, Holland,
Brabant, and all the seventeen Provinces in Netherland,
England, Scotland, Ireland, all America, and Island,
the out Isles of Scotland, the Orchades, Norway,
the Bishopric of Breame, and so home again: all these
Kingdoms, Provinces, and Countries he passed in
twenty-five days, in which time he saw very little that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]

</span>delighted his mind: wherefore he took a little rest
at home, and burning in desire to see more at large,
and to behold the secrets of each Kingdom, he set
forward again on his journey upon his swift horse
Mephostophiles, and came to Treir, for that he chiefly
desired to see this town, and the monuments thereof;
but there he saw not many wonders, except one fair
Palace that belonged unto the Bishop, and also a
mighty large Castle that was built of brick, with three
walls and three great trenches, so strong, that it was
impossible for any prince’s power to win it; then he
saw a Church, wherein was buried Simeon, and the
Bishop Popo: their Tombs are of most sumptuous
large Marble stone, closed and joined together with
great bars of iron: from whence he departed to Paris,
where he liked well the Academy; and what place
or Kingdom soever fell in his mind, the same he visited.
He came from Paris to Mentz, where the river of
Mayne falls into the Rhine; notwithstanding he tarried
not long there, but went to Campania in the Kingdom
of Neapolis, in which he saw an innumerable
sort of Cloisters, Nunneries, and Churches, great and
high houses of stone, the streets fair and large, and
straight forth from one end of the town to the other
as a line, and all the pavement of the City was of
brick, and the more it rained in the town, the fairer
the streets were; there saw he the Tomb of Virgil;
and the highway that he cut through that mighty hill
of stone in one night, the whole length of an English
mile: then he saw the number of Galleys, and Argosies
that lay there at the City head, the Windmill that
stood in the water, the Castle in the water, and the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span>

houses above the water where under the Galleys
might ride most safely from rain or wind; then he
saw the Castle on the hill over the town, and many
monuments within: also the hill called Vesuvius,
whereon groweth all the Greekish wine, and most
pleasant sweet Olives. From thence he came to
Venice, whereat he wondered not a little to see a City
so famously built standing in the Sea: where, through
every street the water ran in such largeness, that
great Ships and Barks might pass from one street
to another, having yet a way on both sides the water,
whereon men and horse might pass; he marvelled
also how it was possible for so much victual to be found
in the town and so good cheap, considering that for
a whole league off nothing grew near the same. He
wondered not a little at the fairness of Saint Mark’s
place, and the sumptuous Church standing therein
called Saint Mark’s; how all the pavement was set
with coloured stones, and all the rood or loft of the
Church double gilded over. Leaving this, he came to
Padoa, beholding the manner of their Academy, which
is called the mother or nurse of Christendom, there
he heard the Doctors, and saw the most monuments
in the town, entered his name into the University of
the German nation, and wrote himself Doctor Faustus
the insatiable Speculator: then saw he the worthiest
monument in the world for a Church, named S.
Anthony’s Cloister, which for the pinnacles thereof
and the contriving of the Church, hath not the like
in Christendom. This town is fenced about with
three mighty walls of stone and earth, betwixt the which
runneth goodly ditches of water: twice every twenty-four

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>

hours passeth boats betwixt Padoa and Venice
with passengers, as they do here betwixt London and
Gravesend, and even so far they differ in distance:
Faustus beheld likewise the Council house and the
Castle with no small wonder. Well, forward he went
to Rome, which lay, and doth yet lie, on the river
Tybris, the which divideth the City in two parts:
over the river are four great stone bridges, and upon
the one bridge called Ponte S. Angelo is the Castle of
S. Angelo, wherein are so many great cast pieces as
there are days in a year, and such Pieces that will
shoot seven bullets off with one fire, to this Castle
cometh a privy vault from the Church and Palace of
Saint Peter, through the which the Pope (if any danger
be) passeth from his Palace to the Castle for safeguard;
the City hath eleven gates, and a hill called Vaticinium,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
whereon S. Peter’s Church is built: in that Church
the holy Fathers will hear no confession, without the
penitent bring money in his hand. Adjoining to this
Church, is the Campo Santo, the which Carolus
Magnus built, where every day thirteen Pilgrims have
their dinners served of the best: that is to say, Christ
and his Twelve Apostles. Hard by this he visited
the Church-yard of S. Peter’s, where he saw the
Pyramid that Julius Cæsar brought out of Africa:
it stood in Faustus his time leaning against the Church
wall of Saint Peter’s, but now Papa Sixtus hath erected
it in the middle of S. Peter’s Church yard; it is
twenty-four fathoms long and at the lower end six
fathoms four square, and so forth smaller upwards,
on the top is a Crucifix of beaten gold, the stone

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>

standeth on four Lions of brass. Then he visited the
seven Churches of Rome, that were S. Peter’s, S.
Paul’s, S. Sebastian’s, S. John Lateran, S. Laurence,
S. Mary Magdalen, and S. Marie Majora: then went
he without the town, where he saw the conduits of
water that run level through hill and dale, bringing
water into the town fifteen Italian miles off: other
monuments he saw, too many to recite, but amongst
the rest he was desirous to see the Pope’s Palace, and
his manner of service at his table, wherefore he and
his Spirit made themselves invisible, and came into
the Pope’s Court, and privy chamber where he was,
there saw he many servants attendant on his holiness,
with many a flattering Sycophant carrying of his meat,
and there he marked the Pope and the manner of his
service, which he seeing to be so unmeasurable and
sumptuous; fie (quoth Faustus), why had not the
Devil made a Pope of me? Faustus saw notwithstanding
in that place those that were like to himself, proud,
stout, wilful, gluttons, drunkards, whoremongers,
breakers of wedlock, and followers of all manner of
ungodly exercises: wherefore he said to his Spirit,
I thought that I had been alone a hog, or pork of the
devil’s, but he must bear with me yet a little longer,
for these hogs of Rome are already fattened, and fitted
to make his roast-meat, the Devil might do well
now to spit them all and have them to the fire, and let
him summon the Nuns to turn the spits: for as none
must confess the Nun but the Friar, so none should
turn the roasting Friar but the Nun. Thus continued
Faustus three days in the Pope’s Palace, and yet had
no lust to his meat, but stood still in the Pope’s chamber,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>

and saw everything whatsoever it was: on a time the
Pope would have a feast prepared for the Cardinal
of Pavia, and for his first welcome the Cardinal was
bidden to dinner: and as he sat at meat, the Pope
would ever be blessing and crossing over his mouth;
Faustus could suffer it no longer, but up with his fist
and smote the Pope on the face, and withal he laughed
that the whole house might hear him, yet none of them
saw him nor knew where he was: the Pope persuaded
his company that it was a damned soul, commanding
a Mass presently to be said for his delivery out of
Purgatory, which was done: the Pope sat still at
meat, but when the latter mess came in to the Pope’s
board, Doctor Faustus laid hands thereon saying;
this is mine: and so he took both dish and meat and
fled unto the Capitol or Campadolia, calling his Spirit
unto him and said: come let us be merry, for thou
must fetch me some wine, and the cup that the Pope
drinks of, and hereupon Monte Caval will we make
good cheer in spite of the Pope and all his fat abbey
lubbers. His Spirit hearing this, departed towards
the Pope’s chamber, where he found them yet sitting
and quaffing: wherefore he took from before the
Pope the fairest piece of plate or drinking goblet, and
a flagon of wine, and brought it to Faustus; but when
the Pope and the rest of his crew perceived they
were robbed, and knew not after what sort, they persuaded
themselves that it was the damned soul that
before had vexed the Pope so, and that smote him on
the face, wherefore he sent commandment through
all the whole City of Rome, that they should say Mass
in every Church, and ring all the bells for to lay the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>

walking Spirit, and to curse him with Bell, Book, and
Candle, that so invisibly had misused the Pope’s holiness,
with the Cardinal of Pavia, and the rest of their
company: but Faustus notwithstanding made good
cheer with that which he had beguiled the Pope of,
and in the midst of the order of Saint Barnard’s
bare-footed Friars, as they were going on Procession
through the market place, called Campa de fiore, he
let fall his plate dishes and cup, and withal for a farewell
he made such a thunder-clap and a storm of
rain, as though Heaven and earth should have met
together, and so he left Rome, and came to Millain
in Italie, near the Alps or borders of Switzerland,
where he praised much to his Spirit the pleasantness
of the place, the City being founded in so brave a
plain, by the which ran most pleasant rivers on every
side of the same, having besides within the compass or
circuit of seven miles, seven small Seas: he saw also
therein many fair Palaces and goodly buildings, the
Duke’s Palace, and the mighty strong Castle, which is
in manner half the bigness of the town. Moreover, it
liked him well to see the Hospital of Saint Mary’s,
with divers other things. He did nothing there worthy
of memory, but he departed back again towards
Bolognia, and from thence to Florence, where he was
well pleased to see the pleasant walk of Merchants,
the goodly vaults of the City, for that almost the whole
City is vaulted, and the houses themselves are built
outwardly, in such sort that the people may go under
them as under a vault: then he perused the sumptuous
Church in the Duke’s Castle called Nostra Donna,
our Lady’s Church, in which he saw many monuments,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span>

as a Marble door most huge to look upon: the gate
of the Castle was Bell metal, wherein are graven the
holy Patriarchs, with Christ and his twelve Apostles,
and divers other histories out of the old and new
Testament. Then went he to Sena, where he highly
praised the church and Hospital of Santa Maria
Formosa, with the goodly buildings, and especially
the fairness and greatness of the City, and beautiful
women. Then came he to Lyons in France, where he
marked the situation of the City, which lay between
two hills, environed with two waters: one worthy
monument in the City pleased him well, that was the
great Church with the Image therein; he commended
the City highly for the great resort that it had unto
it of strangers. From thence he went to Cullin, which
lieth upon the River of Rhine, wherein he saw one
of the ancientest monuments of the world, the which
was the Tomb of the three Kings that came by the
Angel of God, and their knowledge they had in the
star, to worship Christ: which when Faustus saw, he
spake in this manner. Ah, alas good men how have
you erred and lost your way, you should have gone to
Palestina and Bethelem in Judea, how came you
hither? or belike after your death you were thrown
into Mare Mediterraneum about Tripolis in Syria;
and so you fleeted out of the Straits of Giblaterra
into the Ocean Sea, and so into the bay of Portugal;
and not finding any rest you were driven along the
coast of Galicia, Biskay, and France, and into the
narrow Seas, then from thence into Mare Germanicum,
and so I think taken up about the town of Dort in
Holland, you were brought to Cullin to be buried:

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span>

or else I think you came more easily with a whirlwind
over the Alps, and being thrown into the River of
Rhine, it conveyed you to this place, where you are
kept as a monument? There saw he the Church of
S. Ursula, where remains a monument of the thousand
Virgins: it pleased him also to see the beauty of the
women. Not far from Cullin lieth the town of Ach,
where he saw the gorgeous Temple that the Emperor
Carolus Quartus<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> built of Marble stone for a remembrance
of him, to the end that all his successors should
there be crowned. From Cullin and Ach, he went to
Geuf, a City in Savoy, lying near Switzerland: it is
a town of great traffic, the Lord thereof is a Bishop,
whose Wine-cellar Faustus, and his Spirit visited for
the love of his good wine. From thence he went to
Strasburg, where he beheld the fairest steeple that ever
he had seen in his life before, for on each side thereof
he might see through it, even from the covering of
the Minster to the top of the Pinnacle, and it is named
one of the wonders of the world: wherefore he demanded
why it was called Strasburg: his Spirit
answered, because it hath so many high ways coming
to it on every side, for Stras in Dutch is a high way,
and hereof came the name, yea (said Mephostophiles)
the Church which thou so wonderest at, hath more
revenues belonging to it, then the twelve Dukes of
Slesia are worth, for there pertain unto this Church
fifty-five Towns, and four hundred and sixty-three
Villages besides many houses in the Town. From
hence went Faustus to Basile in Switzerland, whereat
the River of Rhine runneth through the town, parting

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span>

the same as the River of Thames doth London:
in this town of Basile he saw many rich Monuments,
the town walled with brick, and round about without
it goeth a great trench: no Church pleased him but
the Jesuits’ Church, which was so sumptuously builded,
and beset full of Alabaster pillars. Faustus demanded
of his Spirit, how it took the name of Basyl: his Spirit
made answer and said, that before this City was
founded, there used a Basiliscus, a kind of Serpent,
this Serpent killed as many men, women, and children,
as it took a sight of: but there was a Knight that made
himself a cover of Crystal to come over his head, and
so down to the ground, and being first covered with
a black cloth, over that he put the Crystal, and so
boldly went to see the Basiliscus, and finding the place
where he haunted, he expected his coming, even
before the mouth of her cave: where standing a while,
the Basylike came forth, who, when she saw her own
venomous shadow in the Crystal, she split in a thousand
pieces; wherefore the Knight was richly rewarded
of the Emperor: after the which the Knight founded
this Town upon the place where he had slain the
Serpent, and gave it the name of Basyl, in remembrance
of his deed.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>

<p>From Basyl Faustus went to Costuitz<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in Sweitz, at
the head of the Rhine, where is a most sumptuous
Bridge, that goeth over the Rhine, even from the gates
of the Town unto the other side of the stream: at the
head of the River of Rhine, is a small Sea, called of
the Switzers the black<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Sea, twenty thousand paces
long, and fifty hundred paces broad. The town
Costuitz took the name of this; the Emperor gave it
to a Clown for expounding of his riddle, wherefore the
Clown named the Town Costuitz, that is in English,
cost nothing. From Costuitz he came to Ulme, where
he saw the sumptuous Town-house built by two and
fifty of the ancient Senators of the City, it took the
name of Ulma, for that the whole lands thereabout
are full of Elms: but Faustus minding to depart
from thence, his Spirit said unto him: Faustus think
on the town as thou wilt, it hath three Dukedoms
belonging to it, the which they have bought with ready
money. From Ulme, he came to Wartzburg the chiefest
town in Frankelandt, wherein the Bishop all together
keepeth his Court, through the which Town passeth
the River of Mayne that runs into the Rhine: thereabout
groweth strong and pleasant wine, the which
Faustus well proved. The Castle standeth on a hill
on the North side of the Town, at the foot whereof
runneth the River: this Town is full of beggarly
Friars, Nuns, Priests, and Jesuits: for there are five
sorts of begging Friars, besides three Cloisters of
Nuns. At the foot of the Castle stands a Church, in
the which there is an Altar, where are engraven all
the four Elements, and all the orders and degrees in
Heaven, that any man of understanding whosoever
that hath a sight thereof, will say that it is the artificiallest
thing that ever he beheld. From thence he went
to Norenberg, whither as he went by the way, his
Spirit informed him that the Town was named of
Claudius Tiberius the Son of Nero the Tyrant. In
the Town are two famous Cathedral Churches, the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>

one called Saint Sabolt, the other Saint Laurence; in
which Church hangeth all the reliques of Carolus
Magnus, that is his cloak, his hose and doublet, his
sword and Crown, his Sceptre, and his Apple. It hath
a very gorgeous gilden Conduit in the market of Saint
Laurence, in which Conduit, is the spear that thrust
our Saviour into the side, and a piece of the holy
Cross; the wall is called the fair wall of Norenberg,
and hath five hundred and twenty-eight streets, one
hundred and sixty wells, four great, and two small
clocks, six great gates, and two small doors, eleven
stone bridges, twelve small hills, ten appointed
market-places, thirteen common hothouses,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> ten
Churches, within the Town are thirty wheels of water-mills;
it hath one hundred and thirty-two tall ships,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
two mighty Town walls of hewn stone and earth,
with very deep trenches. The walls have one hundred
and eighty Towers about them, and four fair platforms,
ten Apothecaries, ten Doctors of the common
law, fourteen Doctors of Physic. From Norenberg,
he went to Auspurg, where at the break of the day, he
demanded of his Spirit whereupon the Town took his
name: this Town (saith he) hath had many names,
when it was first built, it was called Vindelica:
secondly, it was called Zizaria, the iron bridge: lastly
by the Emperor Octavius Augustus, it was called
Augusta, and by corruption of language the Germans
have named it Auspurg. Now for because that Faustus
had been there before, he departed without visiting

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>

their monuments to Ravenspurg, where his Spirit
certified him that the City had had seven names, the
first Tyberia, the second Quadratis, the third Hyaspalis,
the fourth Reginopolis, the fifth Imbripolis, the sixth
Ratisbona, lastly Ravenspurg. The situation of the
City pleased Faustus well, also the strong and sumptuous
buildings: by the walls thereof runneth the
River of Danubia, in Dutch called Donow, into the
which not far from the compass of the City, falleth
nearhand threescore other small Rivers and fresh
waters. Faustus also liked the sumptuous stone bridge
over the same water, with the Church standing
thereon, the which was founded 1115, the name whereof
is called S. Remedian: in this town Faustus went
into the cellar of an Innholder, and let out all the Wine
and Beer that was in his Cellar. After the which feat
he returned unto Mentz<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> in Bavaria, a right princely
Town, the Town appeared as if it were new, with
great streets therein, both of breadth and length:
from Mentz to Saltzburg, where the Bishop is always
resident: here saw he all the commodities that were
possible to be seen, for at the hill he saw the form of
Abel<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> made in Crystal, an huge thing to look upon,
that every year groweth bigger and bigger, by reason
of the freezing cold. From hence, he went to Vienna,
in Austria: this Town is of so great antiquity, that it
is not possible to find the like: in this Town (said
the Spirit) is more Wine than water, for all under the
Town are wells, the which are filled every year with
Wine, and all the water that they have, runneth by

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>

the Town, that is the River Danubia. From hence,
he went unto Prage, the chief City in Bohemia, this
is divided into three parts, that is, old Prage, new
Prage, and little Prage. Little Prage is the place where
the Emperor’s Court is placed upon an exceeding high
mountain: there is a Castle, wherein are two fair
Churches, in the one he found a monument, which
might well have been a mirror to himself, and that was
the Sepulchre of a notable Conjurer, which by his
Magic had so enchanted his Sepulchre, that whosoever
set foot thereon, should be sure never to die in
their beds. From the Castle he came down, and went
over the Bridge. This Bridge hath twenty and four
Arches. In the middle of this Bridge stands a very
fair monument, being a Cross builded of stone, and
most artificially carved. From thence, he came into
the old Prage, the which is separated from the new
Prage, with an exceeding deep ditch, and round about
enclosed with a wall of Brick. Unto this is adjoining
the Jews’ Town, wherein are thirteen thousand men,
women, and children, all Jews. There he viewed the
College and the Garden, where all manner of savage
Beasts are kept; and from thence, he fetched a compass
round about the three Towns, whereat he wondered
greatly, to see so mighty a City to stand all within
the walls. From Prage, he flew into the air and bethought
himself what he might do, or which way to
take, so he looked round about, and behold, he had
espied a passing fair City which lay not far from
Prage, about some four and twenty miles, and that was
Breslaw in Sclesia; into which when he was entered,
it seemed to him that he had been in Paradise, so neat

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span>

and clean was the streets, and so sumptuous was their
buildings. In this City he saw not many wonders,
except the Brazen Virgin that standeth on a Bridge
over the water, and under the which standeth a mill
like a powder mill, which Virgin is made to do execution
upon those disobedient town-born children that be
so wild, that their parents cannot bridle them; which
when any such are found with some heinous offence,
turning to the shame of their parents and kindred,
they are brought to kiss this Virgin, which openeth
her arms, the person then to be executed, kisseth her,
then doth she close her arms together with such
violence, that she crusheth out the breath of the person,
breaketh his bulk, and so dieth: but being dead, she
openeth her arms again, and letteth the party fall into
the Mill, where he is stamped in small morsels, which
the water carrieth away, so that not any part of him
is found again. From Breslaw he went toward Cracovia,
in the Kingdom of Polonia, where he beheld the
Academy, the which pleased him wonderful well.
In this City the King most commonly holdeth his
Court at a Castle, in which Castle are many famous
monuments. There is a most sumptuous Church in
the same, in which standeth a silver altar gilded, and
set with rich stones, and over it is a conveyance full
of all manner silver ornaments belonging to the Mass.
In the Church hangeth the jaw bones of an huge Dragon
that kept the Rock before the Castle was edified
thereon. It is full of all manner munition, and hath
always victual for three years to serve two thousand
men. Through the Town runneth a river called the
Vistula or Wissel, where over is a fair wooden bridge.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span>

This water divideth the Town and Casmere, in this
Casmere dwelleth the Jews being a small walled Town
by themselves, to the number of twenty-five thousand
men, women, and children. Within one mile of the
Town there is a salt mine, where they find stones of
pure salt of a thousand pound, or nine hundred pound,
or more in weight, and that in great quantity. This
salt is as black as the Newcastle coals when it comes
out of the mines, but being beaten to powder, it is as
white as snow. The like they have four mile from
thence, at a Town called Buchnia. From thence,
Faustus went to Sandetz, the Captain thereof was
called Don Spiket Iordan, in this Town are many
monuments, as the tomb or sepulchre of Christ, in
as ample manner as that is at Jerusalem, at the proper
costs of a Gentleman that went thrice to Jerusalem
from that place, and returned again. Not far from
that Town is a new Town, wherein is a Nunnery of
the order of Saint Dioclesian, into which order may
none come, except they be Gentlewomen, and well
formed and fair to look upon, the which pleased
Faustus well: but having a desire to travel farther,
and to see more wonders, mounting up towards the
East over many lands and Provinces, as into Hungaria,
Transilvania, Shede, Ingratz, Sardinia, and so into
Constantinople, where the Turkish Emperor kept his
Court. This City was surnamed by Constantine the
founder thereof, being builded of very fair stone. In
the same the great Turk hath three fair Palaces, the
walls are strong, the pinnacles are very huge, and the
streets large: but this liked not Faustus, that one man
might have so many wives as he would. The Sea

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>

runneth hard by the City, the wall hath eleven Gates:
Faustus abode there a certain time to see the manner
of the Turkish Emperor’s service at his table, where he
saw his royal service to be such, that he thought if
all the Christian Princes should banquet together, and
everyone adorn the feast to the uttermost, they were
not able to compare with the Turk for his table, and
the rest of his Country service, wherefore it so spited
Faustus, that he vowed to be revenged of him, for
his pomp he thought was more fit for himself: wherefore
as the Turk sat and ate, Faustus shewed him a
little apish play: for round about the privy Chamber,
he sent forth flashing flames of fire, in so much, that
the whole company forsook their meat and fled, except
only the great Turk himself, him Faustus had charmed
in such sort, that he could neither rise nor fall, neither
could any man pull him up. With this was the Hall
so light, as if the Sun had shined in the house, then
came Faustus in form of a Pope to the great Turk,
saying, all hail, Emperor, now art thou honoured that
I so worthily appear unto thee as thy Mahumet was
wont to do, hereupon he vanished, and forthwith it
so thundered, that the whole Palace shook: the Turk
greatly marvelled what this should be that so vexed
him, and was persuaded by his chiefest counsellors,
that it was Mahumet his Prophet, the which had so
appeared unto them, whereupon the Turk commanded
them to fall down on their knees, and to give him
thanks for doing them so great honour, as to shew
himself unto them; but the next day Faustus went
into the Castle where he kept his Wives and Concubines,
in the which Castle might no man upon pain

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span>

of death come, except those that were appointed by
the great Turk to do them service, and they were
all gelded. Which when Faustus perceived, he said
to his Spirit Mephostophiles, how likest thou this
sport, are not these fair Ladies greatly to be pitied,
that thus consume their youth at the pleasure of one
only man? Why (quoth the Spirit) mayest not thou
instead of the Emperor, embrace his fairest Ladies,
do what thy heart desireth herein, and I will aid thee,
and what thou wishest, thou shalt have it performed:
wherefore Faustus (being before this counsel apt
enough to put such matters in practice) caused a great
fog to be round about the Castle, both within and without,
and he himself appeared amongst the Ladies in
all things as they use to paint their Mahumet, at which
sight, the Ladies fell on their knees, and worshipped
him, then Faustus took the fairest by the hand, and
led her into a chamber, where after his manner he
fell to dalliance, and thus he continued a whole day
and night: and when he had delighted himself sufficiently
with her, he put her away, and made his Spirit
bring him another, so likewise he kept with her twenty-four
hours’ play, causing his Spirit to fetch him most
dainty fare, and so he passed away six days, having
each day his pleasure of a sundry Lady, and that of
the fairest, all which time, the fog was so thick, and so
stinking, that they within the house thought they had
been in hell, for the time, and they without wondered
thereat, in such sort, that they went to their prayers
calling on their God Mahumet, and worshipping of his
Image. Wherefore the sixth day Faustus exalted
himself in the air, like to a Pope, in the sight of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span>

great Turk and his people, and he had no sooner
departed the Castle, but the fog vanished away,
whence presently the Turk sent for his Wives and
Concubines, demanding of them if they knew the
cause why the Castle was beset with a mist so long?
they said, that it was the God Mahumet himself that
caused it, and how he was in the Castle personally
full six days, and for more certainty, he hath lain with
six of us these six nights one after another. Wherefore
the Turk hearing this fell on his knees, and gave
Mahumet thanks, desiring him to forgive him for being
offended with his visiting his Castle and wives those
six days: but the Turk commanded that those whom
Mahumet had lain by, should be most carefully looked
unto, persuading himself (and so did the whole people
that knew of it) that out of their Mahumet should be
raised a mighty generation, but first he demanded of
the six Ladies if Mahumet had had actual copulation
with them, according as earthly men have, yea my
Lord, quoth one, as if you had been there yourself,
you could not have mended it, for he lay with us stark
naked, kissed and colled<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> us, and so delighted me, that
for my part, I would he came two or three times a
week to serve me in such sort again. From hence,
Faustus went to Alkar, the which before time was called
Chairam, or Memphis, in this City the Egyptian
Soldan holdeth his Court. From hence the river
Nilus hath his first head and spring, it is the greatest
fresh-water river that is in the whole world, and
always when the Sun is in Cancer, it overfloweth
the whole land of Egypt: then he returned again

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>

towards the North-east, and to the Town of Ofen and
Sabatz in Hungaria. This Ofen is the chiefest City
in Hungaria, and standeth in a fertile soil, wherein
groweth most excellent wine, and not far from the
Town there is a well, called Zipzar, the water whereof
changeth iron into Copper: here are mines of gold
and silver, and all manner of metal, we Germans
call this town Ofen<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, but in the Hungarian speech it is
Start. In the town standeth a very fair Castle, and
very well fortified. From hence he went to Austria, and
through Slesia into Saxony, unto the Towns of Magdeburg
and Liptzig, and Lubeck. Magdeburg is a
Bishopric: in this City is one of the pitchers wherein
Christ changed the water into wine at Cana in Galile.
At Liptzig nothing pleased Faustus so well as the great
vessel in the Castle made of wood, the which is bound
about with twenty-four iron hoops, and every hoop
weigheth two hundred pound weight, they must go
upon a ladder of thirty steps high before they can
look into it: he saw also the new church-yard, where
it is walled, and standeth upon a fair plain, the yard
is two hundred paces long, and round about in the
inside of the wall, are goodly places separated one from
each other to see sepulchres in, which in the middle
of the yard standeth very sumptuous: therein standeth
a pulpit of white work and gold. From hence he
came to Lubeck and Hamburg, where he made no
abode, but away again to Erfort in Duringen, where he
visited the Freskold, and from Erfort he went home to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>

Wittenberg, when he had seen and visited many a
strange place, being from home one year and a half,
in which time he wrought more wonders than are here
declared.</p>

<div class="center"><i>How Faustus had a sight of Paradise</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> this, Doctor Faustus set forth again, visited
these countries of Spain, Portugal, France, England,
Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Muscovy, India,
Cataia, Africa, Persia, and lastly into Barbaria amongst
the Blackamoors, and in all his wandering he was
desirous to visit the ancient monuments and mighty
hills, amongst the rest beholding the high hill called
the Treno Riefe, was desirous to rest upon it: from
thence he went into the Isle of Brittany, wherein he
was greatly delighted to see the fair water and warm
Baths, the divers sorts of metal, with many precious
stones, and divers other commodities the which
Faustus brought thence with him, he was also at the
Orchades behind Scotland, where he saw the tree
that bringeth forth fruit, that when it is ripe, openeth
and falleth into the water, whereof engendereth a
certain kind of Fowl or Bird: these Islands are in
number twenty-three but ten of them are not habitable,
the other thirteen are inhabited: from hence, he went
to the hill of Caucasus, which is the highest in all that
Tropic, it lieth near the borders of Scythia, hereon
Faustus stood and beheld many lands and Kingdoms.
Faustus being on such an high hill, thought to look

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>

over all the world and beyond, for he meant to see
Paradise, but he durst not commune with his Spirit
thereof: and being on the hill of Caucasus, he saw
the whole land of India and Scythia, and towards the
East as he looked he saw a mighty clear strike of fire
coming from heaven upon the earth, even as it had
been one of the beams of the Sun, he saw in the valley
four mighty waters springing, one had his course
towards India, the second towards Egypt, the third
and fourth towards Armenia. When he saw these,
he would needs know of his Spirit what waters they
were, and from whence they came. His Spirit gave
him gently an answer, saying; it is Paradise that lieth
so far in the East, the garden that God himself hath
planted with all manner of pleasure, and the fiery
stream that thou seest, is the walls or defence of the
garden, but that clear light that thou seest so far off,
is the Angel that hath the custody thereof, with a
fiery sword: and although that thou thinkest thyself
to be hard by, thou hast yet farther thither from hence,
than thou hast ever been: the water that thou seest
divided in four parts, is the water that issueth out of
the Well in the middle of Paradise. The first is called
Ganges or Phison, the second, Gihon or Nilus, the
third Tigris, and the fourth Euphrates, also thou seest
that he standeth under Libra and Aries right up
towards the Zenith, and upon this fiery wall standeth
the Angel Michael with his flaming sword to keep
the tree of life the which he hath in charge; but the
Spirit said unto Faustus, neither thou, nor I, nor any
after us, yea all men whosoever are denied to visit it,
or to come any nearer than we be.</p>

a mighty great Comet, whereat the people wondered;

course and change of the Sun and Moon, that the
Sun is under the earth, and the Moon above; but
when the Moon draweth near the change, then is the
Sun so strong that he taketh away all the light of the
Moon, in such sort that he is as red as blood: and to
the contrary, after they have been together, the Moon
taketh her light again from him, and so increasing in
light to the full, she will be as red as the Sun was before,
and changeth herself into divers and sundry colours,

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a learned man of the Town of Halberstat,
named N. V. W. invited Doctor Faustus to his table,
but falling into communication before supper was
ready, they looked out of the window, and seeing many
stars in the firmament, this man being a Doctor of
Physic and a good Astrologian, said: Doctor Faustus,
I have invited you as my guest, hoping that you will
take it in good part with me, and withal I request
you to impart unto me some of your experience in
the Stars and Planets. And seeing a Star fall, he said:
I pray you, Faustus, what is the condition, quality, or
greatness of the Stars in the firmament? Faustus
answered him: My friend and Brother, you see that
the Stars that fall from heaven when they come on
the earth they be very small to our thinking as candles,
but being fixed in the firmament there are many as
great as this City, some as great as a Province or
Dukedom, other as great as the whole earth, other
some far greater than the earth: for the length and
breadth of the heavens is greater than the earth
twelve times, and from the height of the heavens there
is scarce any earth to be seen, yea the Planets in the
heavens are some so great as this land, some so great
as the whole Empire of Rome, some as Turkie, yea
one so great as the whole world.</p>

<h3 id="HIST_CHAP_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</h3>
<div class="center"><i>How Faustus was asked a question concerning the
Spirits that vex men</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> is most true (saith he to Faustus) concerning
the Stars and Planets: but I pray you in what kind
or manner do the spirits use or vex men so little by
day, and so greatly by night? Doctor Faustus
answered: because the spirits are by God forbidden
the light, their dwelling is in darkness, and the clearer
the Sun shineth, the further the Spirits have their
abiding from it, but in the night when it is dark, they
have their familiarity and abiding near unto us men.
For although in the night we see not the Sun, yet the
brightness thereof so lighteneth the first moving of
the firmament as it doth that on earth in the day, by
which reason we are able to see the Stars and Planets in
the night, even so the rays of the Sun piercing upwards
into the firmament, the Spirits abandon the place, and
so come near us on earth in the darkness, filling our
heads with heavy dreams and fond fantasies, with
screeching and crying in many deformed shapes: as
sometimes when men go forth without light, there
falleth to them a fear, that their hair standeth on end,
so many start in their sleep thinking there is a Spirit
by him, gropeth or feeleth for him, going round about
the house in his sleep, and many such-like fantasies:
and all this is for because that in the night the Spirits
are more familiarly by us than we are desirous of their
company, and so they carry us, blinding us and
plaguing us more than we are able to perceive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> being demanded the cause why the
Stars fell from heaven, he answered: that is but our
opinion; for if one Star fall, it is the great judgment
of God upon us, as a forewarning of some great thing
to come: for when we think that a Star falleth, it is but
as a spark that issueth from a candle or a flame of fire,
for if it were a substantial thing, we should not so soon
lose the sight of them as we do. And likewise, if so
be that we see as it were a stream of fire fall from the
firmament, as oft it happeneth, yet are they no Stars,
but as it were a flame of fire vanishing, but the Stars
are substantial, therefore are they firm and not falling:
if there fall any, it is a sign of some great matter to
come, as a scourge to a people or country, and then
such Star falling, the gates of heaven are opened, and
the clouds send forth floods, or other plagues, to the
damage of the whole land and people.</p>

they desired him to tell them the cause of that weather.
Faustus answered: it hath been commonly seen
heretofore, that before a thunder-clap fell a shower of
rain or a gale of wind, for commonly after a wind
followeth a rain, and after a rain a thunder-clap:
such things come to pass when the four winds meet
together in the heavens, the airy clouds are by force
beaten against the fixed crystalline firmament, but
when the airy clouds meet with the firmament, they
are congealed, and so strike and rush against the

chamber, whither being come, he said unto him:
Faustus, I have heard much of thee, that thou art
excellent in the black Art, and none like thee in mine
Empire, for men say that thou hast a familiar Spirit
with thee and that thou canst do what thou list: it is
therefore (saith the Emperor) my request of thee that
thou let me see a proof of thine experience, and I
vow unto thee by the honour of mine Imperial Crown,
none evil shall happen unto thee for so doing. Hereupon
Doctor Faustus answered his Majesty, that upon
those conditions he was ready in anything that he
could, to do his Highness’ commandment in what
service he would appoint him. Well, then hear what
I say (quoth the Emperor). Being once solitary in my
house, I called to mind mine elders and ancestors,
how it was possible for them to attain unto so great a
degree of authority, yea so high, that we the successors
of that line are never able to come near. As, for
example, the great and mighty monarch of the world,
Alexander Magnus, was such a lantern and spectacle
to all his successors, as the Chronicles make mention
of so great riches, conquering, and subduing so many

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>

Kingdoms, the which I and those that follow me (I
fear) shall never be able to attain unto: wherefore,
Faustus, my hearty desire is that thou wouldst vouchsafe
to let me see that Alexander, and his Paramour,
the which was praised to be so fair, and I pray thee
shew me them in such sort that I may see their personages,
shape, gesture, and apparel, as they used in
their lifetime, and that here before my face; to the
end that I may say I have my long desire fulfilled, and
to praise thee to be a famous man in thine art and
experience. Doctor Faustus answered: My most
excellent Lord, I am ready to accomplish your request
in all things, so far forth as I and my Spirit are able
to perform: yet your Majesty shall know, that their
dead bodies are not able substantially to be brought
before you, but such Spirits as have seen Alexander
and his Paramour alive, shall appear unto you in manner
and form as they both lived in their most flourishing
time: and herewith I hope to please your Imperial
Majesty. Then Faustus went a little aside to speak
to his Spirit, but he returned again presently, saying:
now, if it please your Majesty, you shall see them,
yet upon this condition that you demand no question
of them, nor speak unto them, which the Emperor
agreed unto. Wherewith Doctor Faustus opened
the privy chamber door, where presently entered the
great and mighty Emperor Alexander Magnus, in all
things to look upon as if he had been alive, in proportion
a strong thick-set man, of a middle stature, black
hair, and that both thick and curled head and beard,
red cheeks, and a broad face, with eyes like a Basilisk,
he had on a complete harness burnished and graven

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>

exceeding rich to look upon; and so passing towards
the Emperor Carolus, he made low and reverent
curtsy: whereat the Emperor Carolus would have
stood up to receive and greet him with the like reverence,
but Faustus took hold of him and would not
permit him to do it. Shortly after Alexander made
humble reverence and went out again, and coming
to the door his Paramour met him, she coming in,
she made the Emperor likewise reverence, she was
clothed in blue Velvet, wrought and embroidered
with pearl and gold, she was also excellent fair like
Milk and blood mixed, tall and slender, with a face
round as an Apple, and thus she passed certain times
up and down the house, which the Emperor marking,
said to himself: now have I seen two persons, which
my heart hath long wished for to behold, and sure it
cannot otherwise be, said he to himself, but that the
Spirits have changed themselves into these forms, and
have not deceived me, calling to his mind the woman
that raised the Prophet Samuel: and for that the
Emperor would be the more satisfied in the matter,
he thought, I have heard say, that behind her neck
she had a great wart or wen, wherefore he took Faustus
by the hand without any words, and went to see if it
were also to be seen on her or not, but she perceiving
that he came to her, bowed down her neck, where
he saw a great wart, and hereupon she vanished,
leaving the Emperor and the rest well contented.</p>

help them at a wish to the town of Menchen
in Bavaria, there to see the Duke of Bavaria
his son’s wedding</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> worthy young Dukes, the which are not here
to be named, but being students altogether at the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>

University of Wittenberg, met on a time altogether,
where they fell to reasoning concerning the pomp and
bravery that would be at the City of Menchen in
Bavaria, at the wedding of the Duke’s Son, wishing
themselves there but one half hour, to see the manner
of their jollity: to whom one replied, saying to the
other two Gentlemen, if it please you to give me the
hearing, I will give you good counsel that we may
see the wedding, and be here again to-night, and this
is my meaning; let us send to Doctor Faustus, make
him a present of some rare thing and so open our
minds unto him, desiring him to assist us in our
enterprise, and assure ye he will not deny to fulfil
our request. Hereupon they all concluded, sent for
Faustus, told him their mind, and gave him a gift,
and invited him to a sumptuous banquet, wherewith
Faustus was well contented, and promised to further
their journey to the uttermost. And when the time
was come that the Duke his son should be married,
Doctor Faustus called unto him the three young
Gentlemen into his house, commanding them that
they should put on their best apparel, and adorn
themselves as richly as they could, he took off his own
great large cloak, went into a garden that was adjoining
unto his house, and set the three young Dukes on his
cloak, and he himself sat in the midst, but he gave them
in charge that in any wise they should not once open
their mouths to speak, or make answer to any man so
soon as they were out, no not so much as if the Duke
of Bavaria or his son should speak to them, or offer
them courtesy, they should give no word or answer
again, to the which they all agreed. These conditions

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>

being made, Doctor Faustus began to conjure, and on
a sudden arose a mighty wind, heaving up the cloak,
and so carried them away in the air, and in due time
they came unto Menchen to the Duke’s Court, where
being entered into the outmost court, the Marshal
had espied them, who presently went to the Duke
shewing his Grace that all the Lords and gentlemen
were already set at the table, notwithstanding, there
were newly come three goodly Gentlemen with one
servant, the which stood without in the court, wherefore
the good old Duke came out unto them, welcoming
them, requiring what they were, and whence: but
they made no answer at all, whereat the Duke wondered,
thinking they were all four dumb; notwithstanding
for his honour sake he took them into his court, and
feasted them. Faustus notwithstanding spake to
them, if any thing happen otherwise then well, when
I say, sit up, then fall you all on the cloak, and good
enough: well, the water being brought, and that they
must wash, one of the three had so much manners as
to desire his friend to wash first, which when Faustus

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>

heard, he said, sit up, and all at once they got on the
cloak, but he that spake fell off again, the other two
with Doctor Faustus, were again presently at Wittenberg,
but he that remained, was taken and laid in
Prison: wherefore the other two Gentlemen were
very sorrowful for their friend, but Faustus comforted
them, promising that on the morrow he should also
be at Wittenberg. Now all this while was this Duke
taken in a great fear, and stricken into an exceeding
dump, wondering with himself that his hap was so
hard to be left behind, and not the rest, and now being
locked and watched with so many keepers, there was
also certain of the guests that fell to reasoning with
him to know what he was, and also what the others
were that were vanished away, but the poor prisoner
thought with himself, if I open what they are, then
it will be evil also with me: wherefore all this while
he gave no man any answer, so that he was there a
whole day, and gave no man a word. Wherefore the
old Duke gave in charge, that the next morning they
should rack him until he had confessed: which when
the young Duke heard, he began to sorrow and
to say with himself, it may be that to-morrow, if
Doctor Faustus come not to aid me, then shall I be
racked and grievously tormented, in so much that I
shall be constrained by force to tell more than willingly
I would do: but he comforted himself with hope
that his friends would entreat Doctor Faustus about his
deliverance, as also it came to pass, for before it was
day, Doctor Faustus was by him, and he conjured
them that watched him into such a heavy sleep, that
he with his charms made open all the locks in the prison,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>

and therewithal brought the young Duke again in
safety to the rest of his fellows and friends, where they
presented Faustus with a sumptuous gift, and so they

<h3 id="HIST_CHAP_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</h3>
<div class="center"><i>How Doctor Faustus borrowed money of a Jew, and
laid his own leg to pawn for it</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a common proverb in Germanie, that although
a Conjurer have all things at commandment, the
day will come that he shall not be worth a penny:
so is it like to fall out with Doctor Faustus, in promising
the Devil so largely: and as the Devil is the
author of lies, even so he led Faustus his mind, in
practising of things to deceive the people and blinding
them, wherein he took his whole delight, thereby
to bring himself to riches, yet notwithstanding in the
end he was never the richer. And although that
during four and twenty years of his time that the Devil
set him, he wanted nothing; yet was he best pleased
when he might deceive anybody: for out of the
mightiest Potentates’ Courts in all those Countries,
he would send his Spirit to steal away their best cheer.
And on a time being in his merriment where he was
banqueting with other Students in an Inn, whereunto
resorted many Jews, which when Doctor Faustus
perceived, he was minded to play some merry jest to
deceive a Jew, desiring one of them to lend him some

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>

money for a time, the Jew was content, and lent
Faustus threescore dollars for a month, which time
being expired, the Jew came for his money and interest,
but Doctor Faustus was never minded to pay
the Jew again: at length the Jew coming home to his
house, and calling importunately for his money,
Doctor Faustus made him this answer: Jew, I have
no money, nor know I how to pay thee, but notwithstanding,
to the end that thou mayest be contented,
I will cut off a limb of my body, be it arm or leg, and
the same shalt thou have in pawn for thy money, yet
with this condition, that when I shall pay thee thy
money again, then thou also give me my limb. The
Jew that was never friend to a Christian, thought with
himself, this is a fellow right for my purpose, that
will lay his limbs to pawn for money, he was therewith
very well content; wherefore Doctor Faustus took a
saw, and therewith seemed to cut off his foot (being
notwithstanding nothing so) well, he gave it to the
Jew, yet upon this condition, that when he got money
to pay, the Jew should deliver him his leg, to the end

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>

he might set it on again. The Jew was with this
matter very well pleased, took his leg and departed:
and having far home, he was somewhat weary, and by
the way he thus bethought him, what helpeth me a
knave’s leg, if I should carry it home, it would stink,
and so infect my house, besides it is too hard a piece
of work to set it on again, wherefore what an ass was
Faustus to lay so dear a pawn for so small a sum of
money; and for my part, quoth the Jew to himself,
this will never profit me anything, and with these
words he cast the leg away from him into a ditch.
All this Doctor Faustus knew right well, therefore
within three days after he sent for the Jew to make him
payment of his sixty Dollars, the Jew came, and
Doctor Faustus demanded his pawn, there was his
money ready for him: the Jew answered, the pawn
was not profitable or necessary for anything and he
had cast it away: but Faustus threateningly replied,
I will have my leg again, or else one of thine for it.
The Jew fell to entreating, promising him to give him
what money he would ask, if he would not deal
straightly with him, wherefore the Jew was constrained
to give him sixty Dollars more to be rid of him, and
yet Faustus had his leg on, for he had but blinded
the Jew.</p>

Summer, for in India and Saba there falleth or setteth

skill had placed a mighty Castle: which when the Duke saw, he wondered
thereat, so did the Duchess, and all the beholders, that on that hill,
which was called the Rohumbuel, should on the sudden be so fair a
Castle. At last Doctor Faustus desired the Duke and the Duchess to walk
with him into the Castle, which they denied not. This Castle was so
wonderful strong, having about it a great and deep trench of water, the
which was full of Fish, and all manner of water-fowl, as Swans, Ducks,
Geese, Bitterns, and such-like. About the wall was five stone doors
and two other doors: also within was a great open court, wherein were
enchanted all manner of wild beasts, especially such as were not to
be found in Germanie, as Apes, Bears, Buffs, Antelopes, and such-like
strange beasts. Furthermore, there were other manner of beasts, as
Hart, Hind, and wild Swine, Roe, and all manner of land fowl that any
man could think on, the which flew from one tree

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>

to another. After all this, he set his guests to the
table, being the Duke and the Duchess with their
train, for he had provided them a most sumptuous
feast, both of meat and all manner of drinks, for he
set nine messes of meat upon the board at once, and
all this must his Wagner do, place all things on the
board, the which was brought unto him by the Spirit
invisibly of all things that their heart could desire, as
wild fowl, and Venison, with all manner of dainty
fish that could be thought on, of Wine also great plenty,
and of divers sorts, as French wine, Cullin wine,
Crabatsher wine, Rhenish wine, Spanish wine,
Hungarian wine, Watzburg wine, Malmsey, and Sack:
in the whole, there were an hundred cans standing
round about the house. This sumptuous banquet
the Duke took thankfully, and afterwards he departed
homewards, and to their thinking they had neither
eaten nor drunk, so were they blinded the whilst that
they were in the Castle: but as they were in their
Palace they looked towards the Castle, and behold it
was all in a flame of fire, and all those that beheld it
wondered to hear so great a noise, as if it were great
Ordnance should have been shot off: and thus the
Castle burned and consumed away clean. Which
done, Doctor Faustus returned to the Duke, who gave
him great thanks for shewing them of so great courtesy,
giving him an hundred Dollars, and liberty to depart
or use his own discretion therein.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> having taken his leave of the Duke,
he went to Wittenberg, near about Shrovetide, and
being in company with certain Students, Doctor
Faustus was himself the God Bacchus, who having
well feasted the Students before with dainty fare,
after the manner of Germanie, where it is counted
no feast except all the bidden guests be drunk, which
Doctor Faustus intending, said: Gentlemen and my
guests, will it please you to take a cup of wine with me
in a place or cellar whereunto I will bring you, and they
all said willingly we will: which when Doctor Faustus
heard, he took them forth, set either of them upon an
holly wand, and so were conjured into the Bishop of
Saltzburg his Cellar, for there about grew excellent
pleasant Wine: there fell Faustus and his company
to drinking and swilling, not of the worst but of the
best, and as they were merry in the Cellar, came down
to draw drink the Bishop’s butler: which when he
perceived so many persons there he cried with a loud
voice, thieves! thieves! This spited Doctor Faustus
wonderfully, wherefore he made every one of his
company to sit on their holly wand and so vanished
away, and in parting Doctor Faustus took the Butler
by the hair of the head and carried him away with
them, until they came unto a mighty high-lopped
tree, and on the top of that huge tree he set the Butler,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>

where he remained in a most fearful perplexity,
and Doctor Faustus departed to his house where they
took their VALETE one of another, drinking the Wine
the which they had stolen in great bottles of glass out
of the Bishop’s cellar. The Butler that had held
himself by the hand upon the lopped tree all the night,
was almost frozen with cold, espying the day, and
seeing the tree of so huge great highness, thought
with himself it is impossible to come off this tree
without peril of death: at length he had espied
certain Clowns which were passing by, he cried for
the love of God help me down: the Clowns seeing
him so high, wondered what mad man would climb
to so huge a tree, wherefore as a thing most miraculous,
they carried tidings unto the Bishop of Saltzburg,
then was there great running on every side to
see a man in a huge tree, and many devices they
practised to get him down with ropes, and being
demanded by the Bishop how he came there, he said,
that he was brought thither by the hair of the head of
certain thieves that were robbing of the Wine-cellar,
but what they were he knew not, for (said he) they had
faces like men, but they wrought like Devils.</p>

come to his house he gave them their welcome, for
they were his dear friends, desiring them to sit down,
where he served them with a very good supper of
Hens, fish, and other roast, yet were they but slightly
cheered: wherefore Doctor Faustus comforted his
guests, excusing himself that they stole upon him so
suddenly, that he had not leisure to provide for them
so well as they were worthy, but my good friends
(quoth he) according to the use of our Country we
must drink all this night, and so a draught of the best
wine to bedward is commendable. For you know
that in great Potentates’ Courts they use as this night
great feasting, the like will I do for you: for I have
three great flagons of wine, the first is full of Hungarian
wine, containing eight gallons, the second of Italian
wine, containing seven gallons, the third containing
six gallons of Spanish wine, all the which we will
tipple out before it be day, besides, we have fifteen
dishes of meat, the which my Spirit Mephostophiles
hath fetched so far that it was cold before he brought
it, and they are all full of the daintiest things that one’s
heart can devise, but (saith Faustus) I must make them
hot again: and you may believe me, Gentlemen, that
this is no blinding of you, whereas you think that it
is no natural food, verily it is as good and as pleasant
as ever you ate. And having ended his tale, he commanded
his boy to lay the cloth, which done, he served
them with fifteen messes of meat, having three dishes
to a mess, the which were of all manner of Venison,
and other dainty wild fowl, and for wine there was no

lack, as Italian wine, Hungarian wine, and Spanish
wine: and when they were all made drunk, and that
they had almost eaten all their good cheer, they began
to sing and to dance until it was day, and then they
departed each one to his own habitation: at whose
parting, Doctor Faustus desired them to be his guests

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> Ash-Wednesday came unto Doctor Faustus his
bidden guests the Students, whom he feasted very
royally, in so much that they were all full and lusty,
singing and dancing as the night before: and when
the high glasses and goblets were caroused one to
another, Doctor Faustus began to play them some
pretty jests, in so much that round about the hall
was heard most pleasant music, and that in sundry
places, in this corner a Lute, in another a Cornet, in
another a Cittern, Gittern, Clarigolds, Harp, Horn
pipe: in fine, all manner of music was heard there
at that instant, whereat all the glasses and goblets,
cups and pots, dishes, and all that stood on the board
began to dance: then Doctor Faustus took ten stone
pots, and set them down on the floor, where presently
they began to dance and to smite one against the other
that the shivers flew round about the whole house,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>

whereat the whole company fell a-laughing. Then
he began another jest, he set an Instrument on the
table, and caused a monstrous great Ape to come in
amongst them, which Ape began to dance and to skip,
shewing them many merry conceits. In this and such-like
pastime they passed away the whole day, where
night being come, Doctor Faustus bade them all to
supper, which they lightly agreed unto, for Students
in these cases are easily entreated: wherefore he
promised to feast them with a banquet of fowl, and
afterwards they would all go about with a Mask, then
Doctor Faustus put forth a long pole out of the window,
whereupon presently there came innumerable of
birds and wild fowl, and so many as came had not any
power to fly away again, but he took them and flung
them to the Students: who lightly pulled off the
necks of them, and being roasted they made their
supper, which being ended they made themselves
ready to the Mask. Doctor Faustus commanded
every one to put on a clean shirt over his other clothes,
which being done, they began to look one upon another,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>

it seemed to each one of them they had no heads, and
so they went forth unto certain of their neighbours,
at which sight the people were wonderfully afraid.
And as the use of Germanie is, that wheresoever a
Mask entereth, the good man of the house must feast
them: so when these maskers were set to their
banquet, they seemed again in their former shape with
heads in so much that they were all known what they
were: and having sat and well eaten and drunk,
Doctor Faustus made that every one had an Ass’s
head on, with great and long ears, so they fell to
dancing and to drive away the time until it was midnight,
and then every man departed home, and as
soon as they were out of the house each one was in his
natural shape again, and so they ended and went to
sleep.</p>

ensued a great Snow, and Doctor Faustus was invited
unto the Students that were with him the day before,
where they had prepared an excellent banquet for
him: which banquet being ended, Doctor Faustus
began to play his old pranks, and forthwith were in
the place thirteen Apes, that took hands and danced
round in a ring together, then they fell to tumble and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>

to vaulting one over another, that it was most pleasant
to behold, then they leaped out of the window and
vanished away: then they set before Doctor Faustus
a roasted Calve’s head: which one of the Students
cut a piece off, and laid it on Doctor Faustus his
trencher, which piece being no sooner laid down, but
the Calve’s head began to cry mainly out like a man,
murther, murther, but, alas, what doest thou to me!
Whereat they were all amazed, but after a while
considering of Faustus his jesting tricks they began
to laugh, and then they pulled in sunder the Calve’s
head and ate it up. Whereupon Doctor Faustus
asked leave to depart, but they would in no wise
agree to let him go, except that he would promise
to come again: presently then Faustus, through his
cunning, made a sledge, the which was drawn about
the house with four fiery dragons: this was fearful
for the Students to behold, for they saw Faustus ride
up and down as though he should have fired and slain
all them in the house. This sport continued until
midnight with such a noise that they could not hear
one another, and the heads of the Students were so
light, that they thought themselves to be in the air
all that time.</p>

<div class="center"><i>How Doctor Faustus shewed the fair Helena unto
the Students upon the Sunday following</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sunday following came these Students home to
Doctor Faustus his own house, and brought their

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>

meat and drink with them: these men were right
welcome guests unto Faustus, wherefore they all fell
to drinking of wine smoothly: and being merry, they
began some of them to talk of the beauty of women,
and every one gave forth his verdict what he had seen
and what he had heard. So one among the rest said,
I never was so desirous of anything in this world, as
to have a sight (if it were possible) of fair Helena of
Greece, for whom the worthy town of Troie was
destroyed and razed down to the ground, therefore
saith he, that in all men’s judgment she was more than
commonly fair, because that when she was stolen away
from her husband, there was for her recovery so great
bloodshed.</p>

<p>Doctor Faustus answered: For that you are all my
friends and are so desirous to see that famous pearl
of Greece, fair Helena, the wife of King Menelaus,
and daughter of Tindalus and Læda, sister to Castor
and Pollux, who was the fairest Lady in all Greece:
I will therefore bring her into your presence personally,
and in the same form of attire as she used to go when
she was in her chiefest flowers and pleasantest prime
of youth. The like have I done for the Emperor
Carolus Quintus, at his desire I shewed him Alexander
the great, and his Paramour: but (said Doctor Faustus)
I charge you all that upon your perils you speak not
a word, nor rise up from the Table so long as she is
in your presence. And so he went out of the Hall,
returning presently again, after whom immediately
followed the fair and beautiful Helena, whose beauty
was such that the Students were all amazed to see her,
esteeming her rather to be a heavenly than an earthly

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>

creature. This Lady appeared before them in a most
sumptuous gown of purple Velvet, richly embroidered,
her hair hanged down loose as fair as the beaten Gold,
and of such length that it reached down to her hams,
with amorous coal-black eyes, a sweet and pleasant
round face, her lips red as a Cherry, her cheeks of
rose all colour, her mouth small, her neck as white as
the Swan, tall and slender of personage, and in sum,
there was not one imperfect part in her: she looked
round about her with a rolling Hawk’s eye, a smiling
and wanton countenance, which near hand inflamed
the hearts of the Students, but that they persuaded
themselves she was a Spirit, wherefore such fantasies
passed away lightly with them: and thus fair Helena
and Doctor Faustus went out again one with another.
But the Students at Doctor Faustus his entering
again into the hall, requested of him to let them see
her again the next day, for that they would bring
with them a painter and so take her counterfeit:
which he denied, affirming that he could not always

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>

raise up her Spirit, but only at certain times: yet
(said he) I will give you her counterfeit, which shall
be always as good to you as if your selves should see
the drawing thereof, which they received according
to his promise, but soon lost it again. The Students
departed from Faustus’ home everyone to his house,
but they were not able to sleep the whole night for
thinking on the beauty of fair Helena. Wherefore
a man may see that the Devil blindeth and enflameth
the heart with lust often-times, that men fall in love
with Harlots, nay even with Furies, which afterward
cannot lightly be removed.</p>

falling sickness. Now Faustus had this use, never
to ride but walk forth on foot, for he could ease himself
when he list, and as he came near unto the town of
Brunswicke, there overtook him a Clown with four
horses and an empty waggon, to whom Doctor Faustus
jestingly to try him, said: I pray thee, good fellow,
let me ride a little to ease my weary legs; which the
buzzardly ass denied, saying: that his horses were
also weary, and he would not let him get up. Doctor

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>

Faustus did this but to prove the buzzard, if there
were any courtesy to be found in him if need were.</p>

<p>But such churlishness as is commonly found among
clowns, was by Doctor Faustus well requited, even
with the like payment: for he said unto him, Thou
doltish Clown, void of all humanity, seeing thou art
of so currish a disposition, I will pay thee as thou
hast deserved, for the four wheels of thy Waggon
thou shalt have taken from thee, let me see then how
canst thou shift: hereupon his wheels were gone,
his horses also fell down to the ground, as though
they had been dead: whereat the Clown was sore
affright, measuring it as a just scourge of God for his
sins and churlishness: wherefore all troubled, and
wailing, he humbly besought Doctor Faustus to be
good unto him, confessing he was worthy of it, notwithstanding
if it pleased him to forgive him, he would
hereafter do better. Which humility made Faustus his
heart to relent, answering him on this manner, well,
do so no more, but when a poor weary man desireth
thee, see that thou let him ride, but yet thou shalt
not go altogether clear, for although thou have again
thy four wheels, yet shalt thou fetch them at the
four Gates of the City, so he threw dust on the horses,
and revived them again, and the Clown for his churlishness
was fain to fetch his wheels, spending his time
with weariness, whereas before he might have done a
good deed, and gone about his business quietly.</p>

Fair, where his Spirit Mephostophiles gave him to
understand that in an Inn were four Jugglers that cut
one another’s head off, and after their cutting off,
sent them to the Barber to be trimmed, which many
people saw. This angered Faustus (for he meant to
have himself the only Cock in the Devil’s basket), and
he went to the place where they were, to behold them.
And as these Jugglers were together, ready one to cut off
the other’s head, there stood also the Barbers ready to
trim them, and by them upon the table stood likewise
a glass full of distilled water, and he that was the
chiefest among them stood by it. Thus they began,
they smote off the head of the first, and presently
there was a Lily in the glass of distilled water, where
Faustus perceived this Lily as it were springing, and
the chief Juggler named it the tree of life, thus dealt
he with the first, making the Barber wash and comb his
head, and then he set it on again, presently the Lily
vanished away out of the water, hereat the man had
his head whole and sound again; the like did they
with the other two: and as the turn and lot came to
the chief Juggler that he also should be beheaded, and
that his Lily was most pleasant, fair, and flourishing
green, they smote his head off, and when it came to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>

be barbed, it troubled Faustus his conscience, in so
much that he could not abide to see another do anything,
for he thought himself to be the principal
conjurer in the world, wherefore Doctor Faustus
went to the table whereat the other Jugglers kept that
Lily, and so he took a small knife and cut off the
stalk of the Lily, saying to himself, none of them
should blind Faustus: yet no man saw Faustus to
cut the Lily, but when the rest of the Jugglers thought
to have set on their master’s head, they could not,
wherefore they looked on the Lily, and found it a
bleeding: by this means the Juggler was beguiled,
and so died in his wickedness, yet not one thought

to persuade him to amend his evil life, and to
fall unto repentance</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A good</span> Christian an honest and virtuous old man,
a lover of the holy Scriptures, who was neighbour
unto Doctor Faustus: when he perceived that many
Students had their recourse in and out unto Doctor
Faustus, he suspected his evil life, wherefore like a
friend he invited Doctor Faustus to supper unto his
house, unto the which he agreed; and having ended
their banquet, the old man began with these words.
My loving friend and neighbour Doctor Faustus,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>

I have to desire of you a friendly and Christian request,
beseeching you that you will vouchsafe not to be angry
with me, but friendly resolve me in my doubt, and
take my poor inviting in good part. To whom Doctor
Faustus answered: My loving neighbour, I pray you
say your mind. Then began the old Patron to say:
My good neighbour, you know in the beginning
how that you have defied God, and all the host of
heaven, and given your soul to the Devil, wherewith
you have incurred God’s high displeasure, and are
become from a Christian far worse than a heathen
person: oh consider what you have done, it is not
only the pleasure of the body, but the safety of the
soul that you must have respect unto: of which if
you be careless, then are you cast away, and shall
remain in the anger of almighty God. But yet is
it time enough Doctor Faustus, if you repent and
call unto the Lord for mercy, as we have example
in the Acts of the Apostles, the eighth Chap. of Simon
in Samaria, who was led out of the way, affirming
that he was Simon homo sanctus. This man was
notwithstanding in the end converted, after that he
had heard the Sermon of Philip, for he was baptized,
and saw his sins, and repented. Likewise I beseech
you good brother Doctor Faustus, let my rude
Sermon be unto you a conversion; and forget the
filthy life that you have led, repent, ask mercy, and
live: for Christ saith, <i>Come unto me all ye that are
weary and heavy laden, and I will refresh you.</i> And
in Ezechiel: <i>I desire not the death of a sinner, but
rather that he convert and live.</i> Let my words good
brother Faustus, pierce into your adamant heart, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>

desire God for his Son Christ his sake, to forgive you.
Wherefore have you so long lived in your Devilish
practices, knowing that in the Old and New Testament
you are forbidden, and that men should not suffer any
such to live, neither have any conversation with them,
for it is an abomination unto the Lord; and that such
persons have no part in the Kingdom of God. All
this while Doctor Faustus heard him very attentively,
and replied: Father, your persuasions like me
wondrous well, and I thank you with all my heart
for your good will and counsel, promising you so far
as I may to follow your discipline: whereupon he
took his leave. And being come home, he laid him
very pensive on his bed, bethinking himself of the
words of the good old man, and in a manner began
to repent that he had given his Soul to the Devil,
intending to deny all that he had promised unto Lucifer.
Continuing in these cogitations, suddenly his Spirit
appeared unto him clapping him upon the head, and
wrung it as though he would have pulled the head from
the shoulders, saying unto him, Thou knowest Faustus,
that thou hast given thyself body and soul unto my
Lord Lucifer, and hast vowed thyself an enemy unto
God and unto all men; and now thou beginnest
to hearken to an old doting fool which persuadeth
thee as it were unto God, when indeed it is too late,
for that thou art the Devil’s, and he hath good power
presently to fetch thee: wherefore he hath sent me
unto thee, to tell thee, that seeing thou hast sorrowed
for that thou hast done, begin again and write another
writing with thine own blood, if not, then will I tear
thee all to pieces. Hereat Doctor Faustus was sore

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>

afraid, and said: My Mephostophiles, I will write
again what thou wilt: wherefore he sat him down,
and with his own blood he wrote as followeth: which
writing was afterward sent to a dear friend of the

became so great an enemy unto the poor old man,
that he sought his life by all means possible; but
this godly man was strong in the Holy Ghost, that he
could not be vanquished by any means: for about two
days after that he had exhorted Faustus, as the poor
man lay in his bed, suddenly there was a mighty
rumbling in the Chamber, the which he was never
wont to hear, and he heard as it had been the groaning
of a Sow, which lasted long: whereupon the good old
man began to jest, and mock, and said: oh what
Barbarian cry is this, oh fair Bird, what foul music is
this of a fair Angel, that could not tarry two days in
his place? beginnest thou now to run into a poor
man’s house, where thou hast no power, and wert
not able to keep thine own two days? With these
and such-like words the Spirit departed. And when
he came home Faustus asked him how he had sped
with the old man: to whom the Spirit answered, the
old man was harnessed, and that he could not once
lay hold upon him: but he would not tell how the
old man had mocked him, for the Devils can never
abide to hear of their fall. Thus doth God defend
the hearts of all honest Christians, that betake themselves
under his tuition.</p>

<div class="center"><i>How Doctor Faustus made a marriage between
two lovers</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the City of Wittenberg was a Student, a gallant
Gentleman, named N. N. This Gentleman was far
in love with a Gentlewoman, fair and proper of
personage. This Gentlewoman had a Knight that was
a suitor unto her, and many other Gentlemen, the
which desired her in marriage, but none could obtain
her: So it was that this N. N. was very well acquainted
with Faustus, and by that means became a suitor
unto him to assist him in the matter, for he fell so
far in despair with himself, that he pined away to the
skin and bones. But when he had opened the matter
unto Doctor Faustus, he asked counsel of his Spirit
Mephostophiles, the which told him what to do.
Hereupon Doctor Faustus went home to the Gentleman,
and bade him be of good cheer, for he should have his
desire, for he would help him to that he wished for,
and that this Gentlewoman should love none other
but him only: wherefore Doctor Faustus so changed
the mind of the Damsel by a practice he wrought,
that she would do no other thing but think on him,
whom before she had hated, neither cared she for any
man but him alone. The device was thus, Faustus
commanded this Gentleman that he should clothe
himself in all his best apparel that he had and that he
should go unto this Gentlewoman, and there to shew
himself, giving him also a Ring, commanding him in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>

any wise that he should dance with her before he
departed. Wherefore he followed Faustus his counsel,
went to her, and when they began to dance they that
were suitors began to take everyone his Lady in his
hand, and this good Gentleman took her, who
before had so disdained him, and in the dance he
thrust the Ring into her hand that Doctor Faustus
had given him, the which she no sooner touched, but
she fell immediately in love with him, beginning in
the dance to smile, and many times to give him winks,
rolling her eyes, and in the end she asked him if he
could love her and make her his wife; he gladly
answered, he was content: and hereupon they concluded,
and were married, by the means and help of
Doctor Faustus, for which he received a good reward
of the Gentleman.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> December, about Christmas in the City of Wittenberg,
were many young Gentlewomen, the which
were come out of the Country to make merry with
their friends and acquaintance; amongst whom there
were certain that were well acquainted with Doctor
Faustus, wherefore they were often invited as his
guests unto him, and being with him on a certain

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span>

time after dinner, he led them into his Garden, where
he shewed them all manner of flowers, and fresh
herbs, Trees bearing fruit and blossoms of all sorts,
in so much that they wondered to see that in his
Garden should be so pleasant a time as in the midst of
summer: and without in the streets, and all over the
Country, it lay full of Snow and Ice. Wherefore
this was noted of them as a thing miraculous, each
one gathering and carrying away all such things as
they best liked, and so departed delighted with their

would have injured him on his journey</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Faustus</span> travelled towards Eyszleben, and
when he was nigh half the way, he espied seven
horsemen, and the chief of them he knew to be the
Knight to whom he had played a jest in the Emperor’s
Court, for he had set a huge pair of Hart’s horns
upon his head: and when the Knight now saw that
he had fit opportunity to be revenged of Faustus he
ran upon him himself, and those that were with him,
to mischief him, intending privily to shoot at him:
which when Doctor Faustus espied, he vanished
away into the wood which was hard by them. But
when the Knight perceived that he was vanished

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>

away, he caused his men to stand still, where as they
remained they heard all manner of war-like instruments
of music, as Drums, Flutes, Trumpets, and such-like,
and a certain troop of horsemen running towards
them. Then they turned another way, and there also
were assaulted on the same side: then another way,
and yet they were freshly assaulted, so that which
way soever they turned themselves, he was encountered:
in so much that when the Knight perceived
that he could escape no way, but that they
his enemies laid on him which way soever he offered
to fly, he took a good heart and ran amongst the
thickest, and thought with himself better to die than
to live with so great an infamy. Therefore being at
handy-blows with them, he demanded the cause
why they should so use them: but none of them
would give him answer, until Doctor Faustus shewed
himself unto the Knight, where withal they enclosed
him around, and Doctor Faustus said unto him, Sir,
yield your weapon, and yourself, otherwise it will
go hardly with you. The Knight that knew none
other but that he was environed with an host of
men (where indeed they were none other than Devils)
yielded: then Faustus took away his sword, his piece,
and horse, with all the rest of his companions. And
further he said unto him; Sir, the chief General of
our army hath commanded to deal with you according
to the law of Arms, you shall depart in peace whither
you please: and then he gave the Knight an horse
after the manner, and set him thereon, so he rode,
the rest went on foot until they came to their Inn,
where being alighted, his Page rode on his horse to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>

the water, and presently the horse vanished away,
the Page being almost sunk and drowned, but he
escaped: and coming home, the Knight perceived
his Page so bemired and on foot, asked where his
horse was become? Who answered that he was
vanished away: which when the Knight heard, he
said, of a truth this is Faustus his doing, for he serveth
me now as he did before at the Court, only to make me
a scorn and a laughing-stock.</p>

he found nothing but coals of fire: there also he heard

this youth was very well acquainted with

well for his own knaveries, as also for his Master’s:
for no man would give him entertainment into his
service, because of his unhappiness, but Faustus: this
Wagner was so well beloved with Faustus, that he used
him as his son: for do what he would his master
was always therewith well content. And when the
time drew nigh that Faustus should end, he called
unto him a Notary and certain masters the which
were his friends and often conversant with him, in
whose presence he gave this Wagner his house and
Garden. Item, he gave him in ready money one
thousand six hundred gilders. Item, a Farm. Item,
a gold chain, much plate, and other household stuff.
This gave he all to his servant, and the rest of his time

a trusty servant unto me and a faithful, and hast not

me before I die what thou wilt, and I will give it unto
thee. His servant rashly answered, I pray you let

me have your cunning. To which Doctor Faustus
answered, I have given thee all my books, upon this
condition, that thou wouldst not let them be common,
but use them for thine own pleasure, and study
carefully in them. And dost thou also desire my
cunning? That mayest thou peradventure have, if
thou love and peruse my books well. Further (said
Doctor Faustus) seeing that thou desirest of me this
request, I will resolve thee: my Spirit Mephostophiles
his time is out with me, and I have nought to command
him as touching thee, yet will I help thee to another,
if thou like well thereof. And within three days after
he called his servant unto him, saying: art thou
resolved? wouldst thou verily have a Spirit? Then
tell me in what manner or form thou wouldst have
him? To whom his servant answered, that he would
have him in the form of an Ape: whereupon presently
appeared a Spirit unto him in manner and form
of an Ape, the which leaped about the house. Then
said Faustus, see, there hast thou thy request, but yet
he will not obey thee until I be dead, for when my
Spirit Mephostophiles shall fetch me away, then shall
thy Spirit be bound unto thee, if thou agree: and thy
Spirit shalt thou name Akercocke, for so is he called:
but all this is upon condition that thou publish my
cunning, and my merry conceits, with all that I have
done (when I am dead) in an history: and if thou

his writing again, and commanding him to make preparation,
for that the Devil would fetch him against
a certain time appointed. D. Faustus mourned and
sighed wonderfully, and never went to bed, nor slept
wink for sorrow. Wherefore his Spirit appeared again,
comforting him, and saying: My Faustus, be not thou
so cowardly minded; for although that thou losest
thy body, it is not long unto the day of Judgment, and
thou must die at the last, although thou live many
thousand years. The Turks, the Jews, and many
an unchristian Emperor, are in the same condemnation:
therefore (my Faustus) be of good courage, and be
not discomforted, for the Devil hath promised that
thou shalt not be in pains as the rest of the damned are.
This and such-like comfort he gave him, but he told
him false, and against the saying of the Holy Scriptures.
Yet Doctor Faustus that had none other expectation
but to pay his debts with his own skin, went on the
same day that his Spirit said the Devil would fetch
him, unto his trusty and dearest beloved brethren
and companions, as Masters, and Bachelors of Arts,

that they would walk into the Village called Rimlich,
half a mile from Wittenberg, and that they would
there take with him for their repast part of a small

together, and there held their dinner in a most sumptuous
manner. Doctor Faustus with them (dissemblingly)
was merry, but not from the heart: wherefore
he requested them that they would also take part of
his rude supper: the which they agreed unto: for

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> trusty and well-beloved friends, the cause why
I have invited you into this place is this: Forasmuch
as you have known me this many years, in
what manner of life I have lived, practising all
manner of conjurations and wicked exercises, the
which I have obtained through the help of the Devil,
into whose Devilish fellowship they have brought me,
the which use the like Art and practice, urged by the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span>

detestable provocation of my flesh, my stiff-necked
and rebellious will, with my filthy infernal thoughts,
the which were ever before me, pricking me forward
so earnestly, that I must perforce have the consent
of the Devil to aid me in my devices. And to the end
I might the better bring my purpose to pass, to have
the Devil’s aid and furtherance, which I never have
wanted in mine actions, I have promised unto him at
the end and accomplishing of twenty-four years, both
body and soul, to do therewith at his pleasure: and
this day, this dismal day, those twenty-four years are
fully expired, for night beginning my hour-glass is at
an end, the direful finishing whereof I carefully
expect: for out of all doubt this night he will fetch
me, to whom I have given myself in recompense of his
service both body and soul, and twice confirmed
writings with my proper blood. Now have I called
you my well-beloved Lords, friends, brethren, and
fellow’s, before that fatal hour to take my friendly
farewell, to the end that my departing may not hereafter
be hidden from you, beseeching you herewith
courteous, and loving Lords and brethren, not to take
in evil part anything done by me, but with friendly
commendations to salute all my friends and companions
wheresoever: desiring both you and them, if
ever I have trespassed against your minds in anything,
that you would all heartily forgive me: and as for
those lewd practices the which this full twenty-four
years I have followed, you shall hereafter find them in
writing: and I beseech you let this my lamentable
end to the residue of your lives be a sufficient warning,
that you have God always before your eyes, praying

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>

unto him that he would ever defend you from the
temptation of the Devil, and all his false deceits, not
falling altogether from God, as I wretched and ungodly
damned creature have done, having denied and
defied Baptism, the Sacraments of Christ’s body, God
himself, all heavenly powers, and earthly men, yea,
I have denied such a God, that desireth not to have
one lost. Neither let the evil fellowship of wicked
companions mislead you as it hath done me: visit
earnestly and oft the Church, war and strive continually
against the Devil with a good and steadfast
belief on God, and Jesus Christ, and use your vocation
in holiness. Lastly, to knit up my troubled
Oration, this is my friendly request, that you would
to rest, and let nothing trouble you: also if you chance
to hear any noise, or rumbling about the house, be
not therewith afraid, for there shall no evil happen
unto you: also I pray you arise not out of your beds.
But above all things I entreat you, if you hereafter
find my dead carcass, convey it unto the earth, for
I die both a good and bad Christian; a good Christian,
for that I am heartily sorry, and in my heart always
pray for mercy, that my soul may be delivered: a
bad Christian, for that I know the Devil will have
my body, and that would I willingly give him so
that he would leave my soul in quiet: wherefore
I pray you that you would depart to bed, and so I
wish you a quiet night, which unto me notwithstanding
will be horrible and fearful.</p>

any such thing before he had opened his mind
to them: wherefore one of them said unto him; ah,
friend Faustus, what have you done to conceal this
matter so long from us, we would by the help of good
Divines, and the grace of God, have brought you out
of this net, and have torn you out of the bondage
and chains of Satan, whereas now we fear it is too
late, to the utter ruin of your body and soul? Doctor
Faustus answered, I durst never do it, although I
often minded, to settle myself unto godly people, to
desire counsel and help, as once mine old neighbour
counselled me, that I should follow his learning, and
leave all my conjurations, yet when I was minded to
amend, and to follow that good man’s counsel, then
came the Devil and would have had me away, as this
night he is like to do, and said so soon as I turned again
to God, he would dispatch me altogether. Thus, even
thus (good Gentlemen, and my dear friends) was I
enthralled in that Satanical band, all good desires
drowned, all piety banished, all purpose of amendment
utterly exiled, by the tyrannous threatenings of my
deadly enemy. But when the Students heard his words,
they gave him counsel to do naught else but call upon
God, desiring him for the love of his sweet Son
Jesus Christ’s sake, to have mercy upon him, teaching
him this form of prayer. O, God, be merciful unto
me, poor and miserable sinner, and enter not into
judgment with me, for no flesh is able to stand before

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span>

thee. Although, O Lord, I must leave my sinful
body unto the Devil, being by him deluded, yet thou
in mercy mayest preserve my soul.</p>

<p>This they repeated unto him, yet it could take
no hold, but even as Cain he also said his sins were
greater than God was able to forgive; for all his
thought was on his writing, he meant he had made it
too filthy in writing it with his own blood. The
Students and the others that were there, when they
had prayed for him, they wept, and so went forth,
but Faustus tarried in the hall: and when the Gentlemen
were laid in bed, none of them could sleep, for
that they attended to hear if they might be privy
of his end. It happened between twelve and one
o’clock at midnight, there blew a mighty storm of wind
against the house, as though it would have blown the
foundation thereof out of his place. Hereupon the
Students began to fear, and got out of their beds,
comforting one another, but they would not stir out
of the chamber: and the Host of the house ran out
of doors, thinking the house would fall. The Students
lay near unto that hall wherein Doctor Faustus lay,
and they heard a mighty noise and hissing, as if the
hall had been full of Snakes and Adders: with that
the hall door flew open wherein Doctor Faustus was,
then he began to cry for help, saying: murther, murther,
but it came forth with half a voice hollowly: shortly
after they heard him no more. But when it was day,
the Students that had taken no rest that night, arose
and went into the hall in the which they left Doctor
Faustus, where notwithstanding they found no
Faustus, but all the hall lay besprinkled with blood,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]</span>

his brains cleaving to the wall: for the Devil had
beaten him from one wall against another, in one
corner lay his eyes, in another his teeth, a pitiful and
fearful sight to behold. Then began the Students to
bewail and weep for him, and sought for his body
in many places: lastly they came into the yard where
they found his body lying on the horse dung, most
monstrously torn, and fearful to behold, for his head
and all his joints were dashed in pieces.</p>

<p>The fore-named Students and Masters that were at
his death, have obtained so much, that they buried
him in the Village where he was so grievously tormented.
After the which, they returned to Wittenberg, and
coming into the house of Faustus, they found the
servant of Faustus very sad, unto whom they opened
all the matter, who took it exceeding heavily. There
found they also this history of Doctor Faustus noted,
and of him written as is before declared, all save
only his end, the which was after by the Students
thereto annexed: further, what his servant had noted
thereof, was made in another book. And you have
heard that he held by him in his life the Spirit of fair
Helena, the which had by him one son, the which he
named Justus Faustus, even the same day of his death
they vanished away, both mother and son. The house
before was so dark, that scarce anybody could abide
therein. The same night Doctor Faustus appeared
unto his servant lively, and shewed unto him many
secret things the which he had done and hidden in his
lifetime. Likewise there were certain which saw
Doctor Faustus look out of the window by night as
they passed by the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 208-209]</span></p>

<p>And thus ended the whole story of Doctor Faustus
his conjuration, and other acts that he did in his life;
out of the which example every Christian may learn,
but chiefly the stiff-necked and high-minded may
thereby learn to fear God, and to be careful of their
vocation, and to be at defiance with all Devilish
works, as God hath most precisely forbidden, to the
end we should not invite the Devil as a guest, nor give
him place as that wicked Faustus hath done: for here
we have a fearful example of his writing, promise,
and end, that we may remember him: that we go
not astray, but take God always before our eyes, to
call alone upon him, and to honour him all the days
of our life, with heart and hearty prayer, and with
all our strength and soul to glorify his holy name,
defying the Devil and all his works, to the end we may
remain with Christ in all endless joy: Amen, Amen,
that wish I unto every Christian heart, and God’s
name to be glorified. Amen.</p>

<h2>UNTO THEM WHICH WOULD
KNOW THE TRUTH</h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T is plain that many things in the first book<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> are
mere lies, for proof mark this: it is said that it
is translated, so it is, and where it is word for word:
But I have talked with the man that first wrote them,
having them from Wagner’s very friend, wherein he
saith many things are corrupted, some added <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de nouo</i>,
some cancelled and taken away, and many were augmented.
As for addition to the Copy is there where
Mephostophiles disputeth of the numbers of Hells,
and some other disputations: And let a man mark
them duly, they shall find them I will not say childish,
but certainly superficial, not like the talk of Devils,
where with foldings of words they do use to dilate
at large, the more subtle by far. But as for his
Obligation<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and the most part, it is certain they are
most credible and out of all question.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>For to take away a doubt, whether there were such a
man, which is generally a thing not believed, I assure
them this, that there was, and it is proved thus, nor is
Germany so unknown but that the truth of these
things following may be found if any suspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>First there is yet remaining the ruins of his house,
not far from Melanchthon’s house as they call at the
town’s end of Wittenberg, right opposite to the Schools.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Secondly, there is yet to be seen his tree, a great
hollow Trunk, wherein he used to read Nigromancy
to his scholars, not far from the Town in a very
remote place, which I think is sufficient testimony to
any reasonable ear. And enquire of them which have
been there, see if they will not affirm it. Notwithstanding
I do not go by these means, to entreat men
to believe, for I care not whether they do or no, but
only to certify you of the truth as I myself would be.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Next, his tomb is at Mars’ Temple, a three miles
beyond the City, upon which is written on a Marble
stone by his own hand, this Epitaph, which is somewhat
old by reason of his small skill in graving.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>If these will not serve, then shall you hear the
testimony of a learned man John Wierus, <i>cap. 4.
libro I. de magis infamibus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Which I have translated.</p>

<p>John Faustus, born at Kundling, a little village,
learning Magic at Gracovia, where he was openly
taught, and exercised it. In sundry places of Germany,
with the admiration of many and with manifold lies,
fraud, and illusions, with vain vaunting and promises
but could do nothing: one example I will shew to
the Reader, upon this condition, that he will pass his
faith first to me that he will not imitate him: Then
rehearseth he one of his knaveries, how he took upon
him to make no hair grow upon a man’s face, and
took away with a powder which I will not name, both
the beard that he had and all the skin, causing such
inflammations in his face that it burned all over
cruelly. This he committed being taken at Batoburg
upon the bank of the river Mosa hard upon the bounds
of Gelderland: Another (saith this learned Physician)
not unknown to me, having a black beard, the rest of
his face somewhat dark and swarthy, witnessing
melancholy (for he was splenetic) when he came to
Faustus, who readily said: Truly I thought you had

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span>

been my Familiar, straightway marking your feet,
whether long and crooked nails stuck out of them:
So likening this man to the Devil, which he thought
had come unto him, which Devil he was wont to call
Sorarius.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>For his death in the same place, thus saith he: At
length he was found in a Village of the Duchy of
Wittenberg by his bedside stark dead, and his face
turned backwards, and the midnight before, the house
was shaken as it is reported. Thus far he, an Author
not to be doubted of, and approved through Christendom
of singular and exact judgment, as appeareth by
his writings of the like argument confutation.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>More in the same place he saith: That a schoolmaster
amongst the Goslaryens, instructed of Faustus
the Magician, or rather Infaustus his evil doctrine,
learned a way how the Devil might be bound by spell
on a glass, who as you may there read was so affrighted,
that lying one whole year speechless, at the end he
spake of his fear and Devil’s appearance, and then
having received his Christian rites died.</p>

<p>As for the Author this Doctor Wier, doubt you not
of his credit, for he is alleged of the very singularest
scholars, as the best that ever wrote in that argument.
We have a Gentleman of our own country, master
Reignold Scot, Esquire,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> that doth universally quote

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</span>

him as his chief and especial help in his discovery of
Witchcraft, yea and he testifieth of him not without
good desert, saying: J. Bode<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in his lawyerly Physic
reasoneth contrarily, as though Melancholy were
farthest off from these old women whom we call
Witches. And the most famous and noble Physician
John Wier for his opinion in that behalf: Lo, where he
calleth him the most famous Physician as he was then
certainly, in the discovery of Witchcraft, <cite>lib. 3. Cap. 7.</cite></p>

JOHN FAUSTUS<br>
<br>
<span class="small">In nomine aeterne &amp; semperuiuae maiestatis, Amen.
Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici.</span></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor John Faustus</span>, whose parentage howsoever
hitherto informed, is known to be base, his father
when he was at the best, but the son of a poor Farmer,
his Mother the daughter of one of the same condition,
born in a small village called Kundling in Slesia,
brought up in literature at Gracovia, after at Wittenberg,
whose life made him famous, and death notorious:
being thus tormented and torn in pieces, at the time
appointed betwixt the Devils and him, moved by this
example woeful and lamentable enough, the hearts
of the Students and Scholars which were witnesses
of his distraughture, that with an inward terror of
conscience vexed and tormented, they departed and
declared the whole volumes of his detestable life,
which afore his Tragedy was thus acted, were not
known. Christopher Wagner, his familiar servant
unto whom he had committed the secrets of his bosom,
and had intimated unto him whatever his four and
twenty years’ familiarity with the black Art, and more

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</span>

black Devils had taught him: He after the death of
his thus slain Master musing at everything thus done,
everything thus done being wonderful: (as men do
whom fear makes passionate and meditation of former
loss urgeth a latter augment of fresh sorrows): in
a distraughtful fury (the Company of Students being
departed, which were eye witnesses of the Doctor’s
lamentable end) conveyed himself unto his Master’s
Library, viewing with sorrowful eyes the only Monuments
of his life, the disputations betwixt him and
Mephostophiles, his answers and demands, and else
whatsoever questions moved or disputed of betwixt
the Devils and him, and memorials of his Heavens and
Hells voyages, his conveyance with many the like
comical journeys. The boy of a sudden fell into
a deep considering of his former merriments, sports
and delights, in so much that in this conceit he flung
out of this study, as if he meant to bury the remembrance
of these matters by contempt and negligence:
coming into the same Hall wherein his Master’s latest
Tragedy was performed, sighing for his want, he
remembered (for as then he lately read it) how that
one Article to the which his Master had bound
Mephostophiles was, that after his death he should be
a Spirit in nature and essence as others were. The Wag
at this began to smile (oh how such things seeming
pleasant make fools’ hearts merry) conceiving with
himself how to make his once Master become his man,
and to have the number of his spiritual followers
doubled, scorning the alonely attendance of one servant.
To this therefore he determined a time for the
raising of his Master’s spirit: and therewith he fell

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 223]</span>

to read earnestly of other matters, so long that he began
to leave as wearied and wearied began to muse.
Suddenly the air began to receive an alteration and
change with a thick foggy mist, as if it would have
shut up the desired day from man’s view, the winds
raged, the thunder lifted up his voice above the
common strain, hail and rain immediately following,
and all these but the ordinary presages of an appearing
Spirit. At this Kit began to tremble, not as afraid
of that which came, but struck with inward horror of
conscience, thinking that no other time had been
appointed to be his doomsday. Suddenly (for always
such haps are sudden) the doors flew open as if they
would have fled from flying, and in all pomp entered
as it were the Prologue of a Comedy, a fellow so short
and little as if he should be of one year, and yet not
so brief as ill-favoured, in his hands a Club, on his
head a Crown of Laurel, riding upon a low Mule,
his name was Gomory, a strong and mighty Duke,
the ruler of six and twenty Legions: and next in
bravery appeared Volac, a great Governor, in the shape
of a Boy with wings like an Angel of Hell, seeming
to be of old rusty iron, riding upon a Dragon with
four heads, in his hands he held a flaming Torch to
give light to the after-comers and beholders: next
after him appeared Asmoday, a King mighty and puissant,
ragged and bristled like a Boar on foot, bearing
a banner or a lance. After him issued Lucifer the
King of the Orient with the four Monarchs of his
dominions, betwixt them were two mighty Spaniels
which drew in a fiery Cart Doctor John Faustus,
whom if reason had not better ruled Wagner would

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>

have saluted, for so natural was his semblance, so
lively his countenance, as if it had either been a new
Faustus, or not the old murdered Faustus, but the
fear which his Master’s harm put him in, cast him besides
the renewing of his old acquaintance, after these came
divers others with trumpets and excellent melody.</p>

<p>This right marvellous triumph thus presented, each
one did his humble obeisance, the best beginning
(though good there were none) and in the end with huge
tumult and echoing of trumpets they crowned him
a King, which when they had done, with the like
ceremonies they conveyed out again the Doctor
whom his wretchedness made a King, and his new
King-ship nothing. Wagner started as if he had
now begun to marvel, amazed at this merry Interlude,
having recovered his memory again, he began softly
to speak to himself in such-like manner. Is this
(quoth he) the honour my Master hath in Hell?
Is this the reverence with which the Fiends infernal
use to entertain such guests? O ye Spirits of Hell,
and ye even now revived Emperors of great Limbus,
from whence have you drawn this extraordinary
humanity, is it to scorn poor Faustus or to mock
Wagner that you shew such reverence to a vile object,
what then would they do to Wagner who is worthy
to have a fitter servant than their King? At these
words he blushed exceedingly, and began to rage very
grievously with his conscience’s terror, and with some
few tears repenting his irreligious conclusion, rose up
from the ground, and supposing it to be but an illusion,
dream, or a temptation, or else some conceit proceeding
from his moist and melancholic fantasy, overpressed

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span>

with too many vapours, raised up by continual thought
into his Pores: wherefore he went forthwith into the
streets (so much he distrusted himself) and demanded
whether it rained, hailed, or thundered, and it was
answered that it neither rained, hailed, nor thundered.
Wagner, albeit he was newly revived from a fear, and
scarcely thoroughly wakened from this his great terror,
yet with this comical jest his decayed spirits began to
recover their old strength and power, turning these
great braveries of Devils into a merriment, and his
conceived fear into a mere fancy. This was the
first time that ever Faustus appeared unto his servant
Wagner, who recited this unto his companions as
a matter of great truth and little moment.</p>

<h3 id="SR_CHAP_II">CHAPTER II</h3>
<div class="center"><i>How certain drunken Dutchmen were abused by their
own conceit and self-imagination, of seeing the

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> shall not be impertinent (my very good friends) to
declare as I am bound by a Translator’s duty, to shew
what these my Dutch friends and Students have
imparted unto me, not for that I will be a King of your
hearts to command you to believe, but that you may
with the rest of the History conceive the common
opinion of him in the vulgar’s belief here in Germany,

About the same time, the next year wherein Faustus

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span>

was thus handled betwixt six and seven o’clock in the
morning, the five and twentieth day of June, 1539,
there chanced certain Scholars to the number of nine,
and five other Merchants (called of them Copfhmen)
two being English, to walk abroad to a little village
within four English miles (which is about one of theirs)
of Wittenberg called Shaftsburg to the intent to make
merry, whither being come they were exceeding pleasant,
as Dutchmen are, especially when they be at
their good Beer, for they are men very impatient of
thirst, wherewith the Italian mocks them saying:</p>

<p>Unto which they merrily answer:</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>So long they drank, that at last they came to be within
a little of drunk, fetching over the <i>Green nine Muses</i><a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
so often at sundry draughts, till they began to be exceeding
merry and pleasant, till it being time to depart,
so they set out for Wittenberg, and being within a
mile or such a matter of the City, they came to a
thick Grove called of them the Phogelwald which is
Bird’s Wood in English, a place somewhat delightsome
above any thereabouts, situated upon a top of a very
high Hill, but the arms of it spread themselves somewhat
lower into the neighbour valleys and meadows,
full of very fine Crystalline brooks and springs, which
running through the large ranks of trees empty themselves
into the Elve, a River which keeps his current

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span>

by Wittenberg; in this place in a fair Summer sunshine
day, gather together a great number of country
maids, servants, and other of the female sex, which
they call Phogels (Birds); unto them there resort in
such-like days, a great number of scholars to meet
with these Birds, which exercise Venery either for
pleasure, but indeed seldom but for gain, with whom
when they have danced a great while (after some odd
tune, as after that which they call Robinson’s delight,
but more truly a jest, though somewhat tolerable)
some twenty or thirty or forty couples together, then
here steps out one couple, and here another, and get
them to such odd corners, as their continual practice
doth make known; on the same day wherein this
merry company were wandering, who if I should not
much err, I durst say they were most deeply drunk,
being a Sun-shining day and having no other way to
pass to Wittenberg, but only by this Phogelwald,
where they determined to be lusty with some of the
Phogels, they came at length to these fore-named
places, where as to them it seemed sundry Women
dancing, and amongst them divers Scholars, and
verily they deemed Magister Doctor Faustus likewise,
and seeing diverse maids standing idle, so many as
would fit their many, they went to take them by the
hands, and as their order is saluting them, to hop
a bout or two (for all the high Dutchmens’ dances
stand upon hopping, turning, winding, and such odd
gesture) and as they seemed, they danced at great
leisure till this said Faustus came to them, requesting
them not to be amazed, for that it was reported he
was dead, assuring them in very deed he was not in this

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span>

World, but had changed it for a better, which if it
did please them he would shew unto them, where
betwixt their delights and his were no comparison,
at his request they were all contented, and he leading
the foremost, brought them down into a fair pleasant
green, whereon instead of certain flowers grew Pots
full of ye best beer, which they tasted on, finding them
as good as any that ever they drunk in their whole lives,
and farther into a most rich and sumptuous palace,
wherein as they seemed they dwelt many days with
great mirth and pleasure, till at length one more full
of courtesy than the rest thanked Master Faustus for
his good entertainment, at which words suddenly
was heard so great a noise and howling especially
of the poor Doctor, who was immediately reared up
into the Air, accompanied with such a sort of black
clouds and mists, as therewith not only the sky, but
also their eyes were mightily darkened, and they brought
into a deep Cavern, wherein besides most soft beds
they had nothing to comfort themselves, in which
they wallowed and slept till they snorted, some of the
Scholars that were present at their departure being
in a soberer conceit than the rest, desirous to see
whither they would go, followed them fast after, till
they espied them on this dirty ease, for instead of
beds they were all bewrapped, and some more than
half sunk in deep and yielding mire by the river’s
banks. Whom when they saw in this more than
miserable case, moved with pity, conveyed them in
Waggons home: and being demanded in the morning
(for then they were a little wiser) the occasion of their
so great and seldom seen disorder, they declared it

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span>

from the beginning to the ending, which they were so
far from believing, that they counted it as canonical,
which when some Students reported unto me, I
could not abstain from hearty laughter, not only to
see how they had abused themselves, but also others
by so fond belief. For I said that in drunkenness,
so thick a vapour as riseth from so thick a matter as
their Beer, clambering up and spreading itself so
universally in the fantasy, maketh it conceive no other
impression, but that which the mind, afore it came to
be overpressed, was conversant about, and it was
evident that in all the talk they had, there was nothing
mentioned but only Faustus, and Faustus’ merriments,
and where a thing is amongst so many so agreeingly
talked of, it is likely it should take effect as well in all
as in one. Well, I was content to subscribe to their
folly rather to satisfy their self-willed conceits, than
mine own thought. Many odd pranks Faustus is
made the father of, which are either so frivolous
as nobody can credit but like frivolous people, or so
merely smelling of the Cask, that a man may easily
know the child by the Father.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Wagner’s conference with Doctor Faustus, and how
miserably they broke up their disputations</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wagner</span> one morning arose betimes and departed to
Wittenberg, but a small mile from the house, and
having purveyed himself of all necessaries, was admitted

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span>

for a scholar (immediately after his Master
was departed out of this World) into the University.
Where, for that he was Faustus’ true and familiar
servant, he was both well and manifoldly acquainted,
wherein he remained in all solace amongst a great
number of his companions, who then rather frequented
his company, not only for that he was Faustus his
servant, whose memory was very freshly continued
among them, but that they were verily assured that
he had a great part of his Master’s skill and
science, which they honoured with more than lawful
reverence.</p>

<p>Upon a day Christopher Wagner (as many times he
did) separated himself from his other companions and
friends, to ruminate upon his melancholic conceits,
erring far in a place full of Trees and the fulness of
Trees gave it the name of a Grove, suddenly like as
all such chances hap, Faustus or Faustus’ Spirit
clapped him upon the shoulder, saying: Wagner,
good morrow. Wagner availed<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> his Scholar’s Bonnet,
thinking verily that he was some other Student, but
beholding his Master Faustus, he was most terribly
affrighted, and stepping aside he began to mumble
to himself a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Benedicite</i>, and crossing himself, rehearsing
and saying <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">CONIVRO TE IN NOMINE PATRIS
ET FILII ET SPIRITUS SANCTI</i>, etc. making
Circle, etc.</p>

<p>Faustus rolling his eyes and for mere fury and anger
stamping, bound (for so he seemed) with the vehemency
of the Exorcism ran about most terribly the
brims thereof, that therewith the neighbour ground

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span>

did seem to tremble, casting out a blackish slomy<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
sulphury smoke out of his mouth, wherewith the bright
air was much darkened, at length appeased, either
forced with necessity or knavery, he spake and that
very distinctly. Wagner (qd. he) art thou afeared
of me as of a Spirit, or infernal Ghost, am not I
(ungrateful rascal) Faustus, am not I thy Master
Faustus? quoth Wagner very confidently, what thou
wert I know, what also thou art who knows not?
Though once my Master, now thou shalt be my
servant, though once my friend and familiar, now I
may justly term thee neither, the Laws of Devils hath
not made me secure from thy tyranny, and how may
thy friendship avail me? For how can that help
which is not? affections are not amongst Fiends, nor
passions amongst Spirits.</p>

<br>

<p>Wherefore Faustus if thou wilt that I be thy
Master, as whether thou wilt or no, I will Conjure
thee, etc. to answer directly and truly to all my questions.
Ah Wagner (quoth Faustus) is this the duty of
a servant? dost thou mistrust that in me, which
neither I mean nor thou of honest thought and duty
oughtest imagine? And as for affections in Spirits,
certainly there is none, but I am none, feel me my
good Wagner, behold flesh, blood, and bones, and
Spirits have neither flesh, blood, nor bones. Believe
me I shall teach thee the nature and essence of Devils,
I will teach thee that which neither thou canst desire
of me or think <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Extra captum humanum</i>. Then my
good Boy Wagner come to me, and use me not as a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 232]</span>

Spirit whose body is nothing but a Spirit, and as
Logicians say <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Substantia incorporea</i>, and I will open
unto thee the secrets of the World, and Hell, and else
whatsoever in the works of Nature. Come my Wagner
my son, my darling, my sweet delight, and rejoicing,
the only hope of my labours, boldly, lovingly, courteously
above all, which am the very same matter and
substance I once was, and if thou doubtest as well
thou mayest reach thy hand to me, for I cannot mine
to thee, and feel whether I am not as I say I am, flesh,
blood, and bones: Wagner half astonished at this his
fervent speech, yet rather hearing it than believing it:
Why Faustus, let me speak to you somewhat more
considerately, thou sayest thou art substance, and all
substance is heavy, and no heavy thing can ascend
upwards, and as thy conference with Mephostophiles
doth plainly declare, the place of Spirits is in the Air,
in which nothing that is heavy can remain, and therefore
thou art not substance or not Faustus. Quoth
Faustus, that no heavy things is in the Air is plainly
false, for thou seest that material bodies are in the
Air, as hail, snow, and other meteors: Whereto
Wagner answered: Faustus, they truly are in the Air,
not of the Air, and you know the causes of them are
terrestrial vapours drawn from the earth by the
attractive virtue of the Sun, and therefore they fall
down because they are heavy, for were they of the
Air as are Spirits, then should they still remain in it,
but briefly no violent motion may be called natural,
as that heavy material Dew is carried from the earth
by a violent and contrary motion: the Sun therefore
leaving the Zenith of any Horizon, and coming to the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 233]</span>

Nadir oppositely, the material bodies of Dew (as the
causes always fail with the effects), and nextly the concretion
of Snow and Hail, because they are substance,
cannot remain in the light and unheavy Air: Wherefore
I have answered thee that thou art either a Spirit
or not substance. I wondered when I read this discourse,
with what patience the Doctor could endure
so long an argument, but it proved otherwise, for the
Doctor brake forth into these speeches, unable to
contain himself any longer. Wagner, thou seemest
to gather natural arguments of Metaphysical effects,
I say unto thee Wagner sith thou art thus far entered
into a Philosophical discourse, that I being as I am
Faustus, may be, for so I am, a dweller in the profound
Abyss of the Air, whose compass is measurable
in this, that it is not measurable: For let us speak
according to men naturally, the rather to fit thy
capacity, we see that in the regiment of man’s body,
the man is of quality like to the predominant complexion
and Element, as if Choler abound, the man is
light, nimble, and for a while furious, seldom strong,
ready to meddle, and carried away with phanatick
illusions: If Blood abound, he is ruddy, fair, gentle,
etc. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Et sic de reliquis.</i> If therefore the predominant
Element is able so much to change the nature of man,
as to make it above the rest capable or incapable, the
same reason maketh that this body of mine which thou
seest, being governed and predomineered by that
quick and ready spirit and soul which makes a man
immortal, is no hindrance why this corporal reality of
me should accompany my Spirit, not as a body, but
as a part of the same Spirit; and otherwise <i>Wagner</i>,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 234]</span>

the whole world is in the Air, and as it were the centre
of the Heavens, and what substances soever is made,
Fishes which dwell in the deep Seas except (and
yet not always) are moved in the Air, Kit, believe
me I am as thou seest Faustus and the same very
same.</p>

<p>Wagner almost at the last cast, said, we dispute not
what you are Faustus, but what by reason you may be.
Well, answered Faustus, seeing thou wilt not believe,
nor give any credit to my sayings, and which I prove
by arguments, I hope thou wilt believe thine own eyes,
and if thou seest what I say unto thee, thou wilt
neither be obstinate nor incredulous, and rather than
Wagner (whom I do love as myself) should be carried
away with so palpable an Heresy, behold Wagner
and believe, and straightways he drew his knife, the
Prologue of his knavery, and looking first upon Wagner,
and next on the weapon which he had in his hand, as
if with his eyes he would have moved him to some pity,
and moved them to be witnesses of the truth, he
struck himself into his thigh twice or thrice, and after
his strokes followed blood so hastily, as if it would
have overtaken the injurious worker of his effusion:
which blood Faustus received in a silver Bowl, and
staunching his wound, but not until the blood might
be seen over the Cup-brims, then Faustus lifted the
blood on high saying: See here the witness of the
truth, Wagner take it, look how fresh it is, it is not that
which comes from a Spirit, it is blood both in nature
and colour, and if this be not enough to make thee
believe that which I do tell thee, it boots not, there is
not any truth at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>I thought it enough for an extemporal Dis<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and controversy,
I thought the scholar had heard as well and
as long as the Doctor had taught, but yet he had not
ended. Wagner receiving the Cup and looking on
the blood, beheld him without saying anything,
shewing by his silence his meaning. Faustus minding
to revenge and recompense Wagner his unbelief, nay
further (quoth he) feel my hand, tell me whether it
hath not the natural heat and essential solidity: then
immediately he stretched forth his arm. Wagner
with sudden ecstasy of joy carried away, ran to embrace
his old Master, as his new friend, whom when
Faustus had encircled he fell to beating the poor
Scholar most miserably, that Wagner’s pitiful roaring
seemed to be an Echo to the Doctor’s blows, now
(quoth Faustus) hereafter be learned either to be more
wary or less mistrustful, and therewith laughing
effusedly vanished away, leaving Wagner to be a
witness (yet almost half dead with his buffeting) of
their conference, and that he was a good substantial
Burgess of Hell: Wagner, poor Boy, for the space
of seven hours not able scarce of himself to stir or to
take breath, and without much stirring either of hand
or foot, whereby any able life might be conjectured:
At length lifting up his head and sighing a little (for
a little was as much as he could do at that time), he
reared himself up, and laying his head upon his hand
and his hand upon the ground, he after sighs sent out
most sorrowful groans, and after groans some feeble
words, as he after reported it to his companions and
familiar acquaintance: to accuse either his Master’s

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 236]</span>

rigour or his own folly, he thought as merely vain as
little prevailing: Wherefore comforting himself with
his misery, because he was comfortless, rose up, and
looking for the cup of blood (for the gain of the silver
moved him): In place whereof he found his Cap full
of piss, and all beraied,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> sore ashamed and sore withal,
so well as he might, which was sorely enough, he rose
up, and what by creeping and going he got home to
his Chamber, where he abode till he had recovered his
health again.</p>

<p>Thus was his Philosophical incredulity recompensed
with rustical cruelty, such was the good love of the
Spirit that for a long space after he was not able to
walk out his Chamber. This did he affirm for most
certain truth, and to his saying added his beaten skin,
a testimonial and witness to his familiarly beloved
acquaintance, one of the which recounted it all summarily
in a Letter from Wittenberg to me, where I
was at Lyptzig, knowing that I intended to certify
my friends in England of a matter so notable and
strange, and worthy of memory, and augmented by
Fame more than of very deed, for the idle-headed
fellows having gotten such a notable fellow as Faustus
to Father their lies upon, ceased not daily and hourly
to beget new children, but they cost very little nursing
and bringing up, they had the wide World, a very
good Grandam where they might feed their fill:
As for the disputations betwixt those two in this place,
and those which you shall find in other places likewise
abundantly, consider from whose brains they
proceed, for you must give the German leave to shew

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span>

his Art, for wit for the most part they have very little,
but that which they toil for like Cart Horses. But in
all their doings you shall easily perceive if anything
be in them excellent, either with how much liking and
urging they bring it forth or how it is wetted over with
dropping of the Tap exceedingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wagner</span> solitary musing in his Chamber and conversing
with many multitudes of thoughts, suddenly
appeared Mephostophiles, his master’s Familiar, after
him Akercocke, which was Wagner’s, and after all
Faustus: Quoth Mephostophiles, what cheer? Sirrah
such as you see, we are as we were and never-the-better:
and welcome Akercocke, but my very good Faustus,
that you come at this time I rejoice. So then they all
sat down, and sat right against him. Then entered in
divers delicate viands, and there not then to be ended,
with unseen Symphonies of Music. Then spake
Wagner and said <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Claudite iam riuos</i>, now we have
satisfied our appetite with meat, I pray you hear me
with patience, for I have a thing in my mind of which
I would fain be resolved, but because you so foully,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span>

and so often foully entreated my Master, for demanding
some questions, you shall ratify this Article with me
again. I. <i>That in my demands you shall answer truly
and patiently</i>, for what hurt can redound to you by
answering of a question, seeing if you are sure of anything
you may hold fast, a question cannot take it
away: Without delay these good fellows confirmed
the Article with a great oath: but he would take their
simple word without surety, he knew their honesty so
well. Then Wagner pulling down his Cap into his
eyes, and leaning upon his elbow a while, and throwing
up his eyes to heaven, and then sighing, at length
folding his arms within themselves, sat still a little
time, then spitting a little and fetching a hearty hem,
with a good courage spake unto them thus.</p>
<br>

<p class="p2">Sirs, it is not unknown unto you how dear I have
always accounted of my Master, whose condition is
as far from that it was as mine from yours, for which
I have more often lamented his departure than mine
own misery, being once every way a man, so thoroughly
instructed with the weapons of all Sciences, that in all
the world hardly his peer could be found, so that your
victory over such a man is more to be wailed than over
many a thousand such as I am. To be short, that you
may understand whither I will go without further
Oration. Wherefore I desire you, I pray you, nay I
by your Article command you, that you declare unto
me truly without collusion, whether that Faustus here
present in that state wherein he now is, may come
again to be a living man amongst us, either his old
shape renewed, or he in a new: For some Philosophers

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>

say, and some Divines, as Origenes and Tertullian,
and whether they say truly or no I know not, that no
sooner the soul of man departeth from one but that it
both enter into another. Wherefore I considering
with myself thus much, and often for his cause that
he may not only be Faustus, but also a living man and
dweller upon the earth, to enjoy not only those graces
which through his great deserts he had lost, but also
according to his infinite knowledge, multiply them
through God’s favours again and again abundantly.
And though you shall perhaps deny that the same
Individual cannot be again so resuscitated, yet that
Numero it may in spite of you all, I know it may: for
we do not doubt that the same Individual may Numero
be again regotten, because that after seven and thirty
thousand years, the heavenly constellation shall be in
every point <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per totum</i> the same then that now it is, according
to Plato and the Astronomers. And therefore
we shall be ye same in Numero, and shall sit in this or
that school or place as now we do, that is in that <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Magno
anno</i>, in that great year: Whereupon Plato said, that
after the great year he should return to Athens, and
should there read: Because the constellation shall
happen so, therefore that returning, the same effects
shall with them likewise return. Now having heard
my resolution, answer me to my first proposition in
full and amply, as that I may be satisfied. At the
conclusion of this speech Faustus turned his head
aside laying it betwixt his hands hiding it, so sat a
great while. Akercocke he frisked up and down, for
he had neither clog nor chain, because he was in the
number of the wild ones, and over the table and back

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span>

again. Akercocke was the familiar which Faustus
gave to Wagner who asked him in the fashion of an
Ape. Such cranks, such lifts, careers and gambalds,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
as he played there, would have made a horse laugh.
Mephostophiles who as it seemed was the speaker of
ye Parliament in hell, rose and walked about very
hastily, at length he came to the table and striking his
fist on it (the print was seen two years after, and was
carried to S. Marget’s church for a relique, to shew
what a hot fellow the Devil is in his anger) and
again beating said, thou, and then left, and came
and went, and came and went again, here he
takes me one book and hurls it against a Cupboard,
and then he takes the Cupboard and hurls
it against the wall, and then he takes the wall and
throws it against the house, and the house out at the
Window. Pacifying his rage at the length, rolling his
eyes, and seeming to beat his teeth together, sat down
further off, and thus quietly spake with a loud voice.
Were it not Wagner that our solemn vow forbiddeth
to disturb or torment thee for any demands, this thy
fond pride should be rewarded with most intolerable
punishments: As for the question, I will answer thee
more substantially than such a foolish doltish one doth
require. And for that we have day enough before us,
I will travel further in it then ye gravity of the argument
can require, if it be but that thou mayest see how great
an Ass thou art, which canst imagine so gross a matter
in thy more gross head: As for thy great Peer,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
be it as you expect it you, in the mean we will enjoy
him and thee at our pleasure in despite of God and
Heaven and all his imperial armies of saints. Thy
question is this: <i>Whether the Spirit of a damned man
can return into the body of another man.</i> To which
I answer Negatively, it cannot.</p>

<div class="caption">THE CASTLE OF WITTENBERG IN THE YEAR 1611
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p class="p2">1. If this were to them granted, then they should
observe and keep the Embryons in the Womb of the
mother, that they might constitutively unite themselves
to it, to have at the leastwise, sensual consolation and
delectation.</p>

<p class="p2">2. Then secondly, because it is common to reasonable
creatures to fashion and informate the body, and
to perfect it with some natural delightment, not to
vex it.</p>

<p class="p2">3. Then thirdly, because of the law and order of
Nature, the souls from the places in their departure to
them allotted, assigned and deputed of God, neither
do nor can depart at any time: for it is written:
For the soul is a Spirit going and returning. And they
which do otherwise hold opinion are to be accused,
nay condemned in this with Pythagoras, who did
abstain from all living Animals and creatures, believing
that in some the souls of some men did dwell and
abide. Thus far the Arrogonian named Bartholomew
Sybilla,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
a Monopolitan, who writ upon this question
being at Wittenberg, at the request of him that did
set forth the Dutch Copy, shews himself to be a good
Philosopher and no worse Divine. But mark what
follows, this is written according to men in faith: the
Devil was out of the first street of Coany when he was
past this last period. For that Pythagorical opinion,
if that were: this absurdity would follow: (I will

speak plainly the rather to fit thy capacity), and if
the soul should pass out of the dead into the living,
then should mortality be the cause of the soul’s
immortality (this is prettily spoken) and by that
means make it corruptible, which cannot be. And seest
thou Wagner? for I will teach thee by demonstrations,
and therewith he took a coal of fire, and held it to him
so long that it came to be but a coal, now thou seest
Wagner, that so long as fire was in this subject it had
life, but the quality being removed from the quantity,
neither is the quality found or seen or known whither
it vanisheth, nor can the same fire though fire may
return into another body or subject albeit the quantity
remaineth. Thus may the soul of man be compared
to the fire in the coal, as concerning his entrance and
departure, but not re-entrance, for that coal may take
life again, that is fire, but so cannot human body,
because one spirit can be united but to one body, and
not two to one, nor one spirit to two bodies: Wherefore
that Spirit being departed, it is irrevocable because
of the unity, and the impossibility of returning in
the one, in the other of receiving any other. As for
other reasons directly by circumstance, if the Soul
goeth either to joy or pain immediately, then I am
certain that that hope which thou hast is so merely
vain, as anything which may hap under that title: For
proof behold, and then through the Wainscot door
of Wagner’s study entered in two Kings, which drawing
their swords did there in presence combat together
fiercely and courageously, one of them shortly after
fainting under the adversary’s strokes fell down, the
other victorious, yet wounded, very canonically as

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 246]</span>

a man may say, staggered immediately, as if he would
fain have not fallen, yet for all that, he fell; then
entered two men carrying Torches with the snuffs
downwards, with great solemnity (more than is needful
to be recapitulated, for I see nothing but that this
might have been very well left out for anything worthy
the gravity of the matter) which when they had carried
out the first slain combatant, with armed men, and a
dying stroke of the Drum, clothed all in the colour
which best notes by his external hue the internal sorrow.
Then next there entered two Pages all in silver white,
crowned with Bays, carrying their Torches aloft
declaring the height of their glory by the height of
their flames: next to them divers Trumpeters and all
in white, urging forth into the vast air their victorious
flourishes, next a great standard bearer, and I cannot
tell what, but the conclusion was, that the triumph
was exceeding great and pompous, adorned with as
many ceremonies as such a victory might or could be,
the Spirit when they were all gone began to speak
and said, this was the battle which was fought for the
great Realm of Asia, by Hercules and Orontides,
where Orontides was slain, and Hercules sore wounded,
but yet recovered, after which he achieved his twelve
labours, and the thirteenth of which the Poet speaketh,
the hardest of all.</p>

<p class="blockquote-p246">
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tertius hinc decimus labor est durissimus, una<br>
Quinquaginta simul stuprauit nocte puellas.</i><br>
</p>

<p>This History is as I do think in the Chronicle of
Hell, for I did never hear of it before, nor anybody
else, I appeal to all the Histories. Marry it may be
this was when Hercules was a little Boy, and then

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span>

peradventure indeed the records make no mention
of it, but yet we have that recorded which he did
when he was less than a little Boy, as his killing of a
Serpent in his Cradle, and such a History as I do
remember is enrolled in the golden Book of the seven
wise Masters of Rome, an authentical author. But
let that pass and let us draw more near unto the cause:
For as the Devil was afore our days, so by authority
he may allege experience, and we must of necessity
believe that it is either true or a lie. Mephostophiles
continued his speech for all this parenthesis, declaring
to Wagner his meaning in this point for (quoth he)
as you see these two champions contending for the
title of victory, one of them must needs, if they try
the extremest as they did, receive the dishonour, the
other the glory, so in the combat wherein the dying
body battleth with the lively soul, the soul, if grace
hath made acceptable, shall enjoy those everlasting
pleasures of Paradise, and dwell in heaven blessed
and glorious amongst the beautiful Angels, but if it
be counted as reprobate and outcast of God, then
according to that punishment which his great sins
did deserve, he can have no other place but the
continual horror of hell, wherein we miserable dwell,
and the ugly company of black Devils and his frightful
Angels. There is no other mean but honour or dishonour
in this case, no other mean but joy or pain, no
other mean but heaven or hell perpetually: there is
no place left for a third. I could more copiously dispute
of this matter, but that I will not be too tedious in so
exile<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> a question. For where it is said in an author

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span>

to which I am witness, for I stood by his elbow when
he writ the lines. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Animae sunt in loco certo et expectant
indicium neq; se inde possunt commouere.</i> Which
place as appeareth in the precedent chapter is heaven
or hell: again it is said <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anima quae pecauerit ipsa
morietur</i>. Of necessity then the soul to whom the
Lord imputeth not his sin shall live, for they are immediate
oppositions, for the soul that is in joy will not
come to these troubles, nor that which is in torment
cannot: therefore it is said: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Et reuertatur puluis
in terram quemadmodum erat, et spiritus reuertatur
ad Dominum qui dedit ilium</i>, so there is no mention in
any scripture of the soul’s returning, but to a certain
place deputed of God to him. But before I go any
further in ye declaring of that which is here to be set
down, I know they that have their consciences more of
the precise cut, will say, that here was a learned Devil,
true it is he is learned, strong, and above all human
conceit, subtle and crafty: and if they say it is blasphemously
done to have the word spoken to the world
by so vile a mouth, first they know how mightily the
Devil is conversant in holy writ, in anything to over-throw
a Christian thought, knowing that as ye word
of God is a word of power to attain salvation to whom
grace is given: and to work eternal damnation where
that gift is wanting, knowing it is the only means to
debel<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and conquer the Christian thought, for as a
man is governed by a law and by it lives, so if anything
be evidently directed against him in it, it slays his heart,
it overthrows him, it takes away his power for ever,
nor is it more blasphemous to be spoke to us men, than

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span>

to God himself, as it is in S. Alathero, where the Devil
was not afeared, to assail his creator with most terrible
arguments of the divine letter. They which have
right minds can persuade themselves accordingly:
but otherwise they may cavil as long as they will,
which they may do to their small profit, assuring
them this that in coveting by fault finding to seem
learned, they make themselves the notes and reproach
not only of the learned, but even of the absurd and
barbarous rude fools, and that they are the only spirits
of error and contention, and the chief causes of unbelief
by vain reasonings and questions to the unresolved
Christian. But as for this speech which is
but <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Humile dicendi genus</i> in very truth, let them thus
think, that if there were any such controversy betwixt
Wagner and his Spirit, as is here mentioned, that those
are not the words which were spoken, but that they
do proceed from a young Scholar who gave me this
copy, and not of a Devil, of whose familiarity and
frequency and of other circumstantive causes, I will
God willing in the Catastrophe and conclusion of this
Book deliver unto you my poor opinion. In the meanwhile
I will follow the matter into which we are fallen,
my good friends, and without further ado I pray
without any more excusive phrase, patiently expect
the good hour wherein the death of this volume is
prepared: Mephostophiles taking breath a little,
presented his speech saying: it is said likewise.
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Factum est autem vt moreretur mendicus, etc. And it
came to pass that the beggar died, and was carried away
of Angels into Abraham’s bosom, and that rich man died
and was buried, and he being in Hell lifted up his eyes,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span>

when he was in torments, and saw Abraham afar off
and Lazarus in his bosom.</i> Nor nothing doth that
impugn which is said of the Papist, that he cannot
come into God’s presence nor be one of the elect
unless they be purified from their sins, for which
purification, they ordain a place so terribly stuck with
pins, needles, daggers, swords, nails, etc., so soultring<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
with hot burning furnaces, and so every way formidable
with material sulphury fires, that no tongue can express,
nor any heart imagine, wherein the sinful
soul must be many times and often cleansed, but I
hope if this were true then Lazarus should have been
likewise so dressed in their terrible imagined terrors,
which he was not, unless they will be so impudent to
say that he had no sin. I shall not need to dispute
how absurd it is to say that the sin of the soul in the
body committed, must be extirpated and purified
by a material substance and rigour, nor of the matter
of the like argument. And hereupon he seemed to
sigh as if some sudden thought had overpressed his
stomach. I can, quoth he, largely discourse of all
divine and human propositions, but as the unlearned
Parrot who speaketh oft and much, and understandeth
never anything to profit himself. Ah that unto us
Spirits no secrets are secret, no doings of man unhid,
and yet we Devils cursed of God are incapable of any
of God’s mercies, though through them we were
created. We know repentance is the way to attain
the celestial favour: we know God’s mercies how great
they are, and that we ought to despair of nothing, yet
there is nothing (such is our seeing blindness) so it

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span>

appertain to God and godliness, of which we do not
despair. No, Wagner, we are so far from living again,
as we are from certainty to be saved. But instead of
that we are crossed with all kind of vexation, for
since the first time that I with my Master and fellows
fell down from heaven, being of the most royal order
of Angels, Potestates, Cherubins, and Seraphins,
riding upon the wrings of the Wind in all bright
shining Majesty, and enjoying the most glorious and
divine presence of our Creator, till for our heart-swelling
pride, and haughty insolency, within as
little space of time as we were created in, with his
dreadful lightning threw us down headlong into the
bottomless Abysses of the Air, wherein we endure
these tortures and like wicked souls with us, as our
manifold deserts have brought upon us. And for that
we know that the way to mercy is utterly denied, and
that we are as much hated of ourselves as of God, we
think it the sweetest remedy in these manifold miseries
to have partakers of our common woe with us. Wherefore
it is most expedient for us to be thus enviously
malicious against all mankind, making them too as
far in God’s dreadful curse as ourselves.</p>

<p>Wagner melting at these words, his eyes undid the
great burthen of his sorrow, straining himself so long
that he wept, and yet could say nothing, but only a
small volley of sobs hastily following: Mephostophiles
seeing how Wagner was drowned in so deep a melancholy,
told him pulling him by the sleeve, that he
would be still demanding of such foolish questions
which will profit him so little as mought be. Knowest
thou not (quoth he) that all the Rhetorics are the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 252]</span>

servants of my tongue, or that we can move pity or
hatred when we please, fool as thou art, forget these
vain conferences, persuade thyself that they are but
the effect of speech, long canst thou not live, and yet
dost thou live as if thou didst not long: youthly
should be thy thoughts, and fraught with the rank
lustiness of conceit and amorous delight, if thou
wilt ask questions, let them be such as appertain to
love and wealth, to pleasure, to pastime, and to merriment.
How sayest thou to such a one, naming a
Gentlewoman, the most beautiful Lady under the
cope of Heaven? Thou shalt enjoy her, nay, anyone
so she be one whom thou lists to call beautiful, whosoever
thy eyes shall lay their delight upon. And presently
Music was heard so sweet, so plenteous, and
so ravishing, as if on Music depended all sweet, all
plenty, all ravishment. The doors conveying themselves
aside, as giving place to so divine a fairness,
entering in a blue Velvet Gown raised, and thickly
beset in the gards<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> with most pure Ooches<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> of gold,
not altogether ignorant of precious stones, furred
with royal Ermines, loose about her: her head’s
ornament (though greater ornament to her head than
her head there could not be) was a kind of attired
Caul (such as I have seen none in England according
to their description) raised up at the corners with
stiff square wires of beaten gold, on that a Chaplet
or frontier of Roses, on the Chaplet a veil of Lawn,
which covered all her fair body denying the sight of
such an Angel, but only through a shadow: In brief

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]</span>

she was such a one as would have roused the basest
desire in the whole World to attempt wondrous
enterprises, in her hands silken soft, she held a Lute,
discoursing sweetly upon the solemn strings with her
nimble fingers. A maid carrying a blue waxen Taper
in a silver white Candlestick made in the fashion of
a Censer, but it was derived into two several branches,
in whose ends were curiously wrought two most
beautiful places to pight<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> tapers on. The maid by
her Lady would have well contented a reasonable
proper Squire, it was a pretty rank lass, round about
as plump as a Bladder, which being yet smoking new
is blown up with Wind: well I will not trouble you
with these rude descriptions any longer, but desire
you to conceive the excellency of this fair Lady, for
it is far more copious in the Dutch Copy than is here
necessary to be recapitulated. Wagner’s heart leaping
at this sight looked about him, as if he would have
nobody privy to himself but himself, and so it was
indeed, for Faustus, Mephostophiles, and Akercocke
were gone, and thereupon with a boon courage advancing
himself upon his toes, and weeding himself
in the best German fashion, as he could very well,
began to travel unto her, but remembering his bad
apparel stepped back and blushed, and hid his face,
but suddenly returning again as if he had known now
how rather to become his weeds, began to fewter<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
himself, but, O wonder, his habit was changed with
his thought, and he was now no more Wagner but
Armisuerio the Lady’s Lord. And to be short this
new Armisuerio and old Wagner met with the Lady,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span>

and saluting her in the best kind of <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Bon noche</i>,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> used
her as he would do his Lady, and she him as her Lord.
So passing over their weary night in such pleasure
as I could find in my heart to enjoy, or any Man
(unless an Eunuch beside).</p>

<h3 id="SR_CHAP_VII">CHAPTER VII</h3>
<div class="center"><i>The arrival of the Messenger at Wittenberg, and
the description of Wagner</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is time to wind about another furrow with our
sweating Team and bring our speech to another matter,
entering out of one into another, for change is sweet.
Not forgetting by the way the Pursuivant, or, as we
may better call him, a Messenger, who lately departed
from Vienna in Austria, and I think by that time this
disputation was finished, had almost overtaken all
the way betwixt him and home, which was some
fifteen days’ travel, after five German miles to the day’s
labour, and arrived at Wittenberg, by enquiry came to
Wagner’s chamber, which was in the way as ye go to
the Public Schools, as ye go from Melanchthon’s house,
a pretty house and of a reasonable large size built of
hewn stone, and environed with a good thick Wall,
of some three foot and a half thick and twenty high,
at the bottom guarded about with a good broad Mount
of seven yards over, and round about very large and
secret walks, far from all company and resort, and there

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 255]</span>

he might talk without fear with the Devil and his
Dam too, thither this fellow coming, knocked peremptorily
at the door, Wagner was even now gone to his
study and rising up in a Pedlar’s chafe,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> that he should
go to his book, especially if it were goodness not once
in a month, and yet then to be troubled, he swore
a little thing would make him never study more, it
should not, but putting on his cloak and his hat,
came down and unbolted the door: Unto whom the
Messenger seeing such a pretty jolly fellow did some
little of reverence, Wagner as yet scarce having let
down his choler, stepped back, and perceiving him
wear such a Weed as Serjeants there do use to wear,
thinking with himself that some had come from the
prince for cozening of his servants, shut the door upon
him and went pouting and swearing and pitifully
chafing, that if the knave offered to sue him, he would
surely kill him at the least, down he fetched a good
Bastinado and set it behind the door and opened it
again, and demanded somewhat mildly what he had
to say unto him, to whom the Messenger said, that he
came from the Arch-Duke of Austria from Vienna,
who willing to hear some certainty of his Master, did
send for him assuring himself, that not only he could
satisfy his desire in that matter, but also shew
him as much skill as ever his Master had. Wagner
hearing the purpose of his message with good effectual
words, thanked him again, and rendered most serviceable
reverence to his good Lord and Master for
remembering so gently of his poor servant, etc.
Desiring him to tarry until he might set everything in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 256]</span>

due order and he would not fail to go with him. The
Messenger did not deny him, and so they went up
together into their Chamber, whom ever after the
Messenger loved dearly for his proper behaviour and
personage, for indeed Wagner was a very goodly
young man, being about the common stature, straight
and reasonably slender, well trussed, his hair very
yellow and his face fair, his beard which did but now
express the blossoms of his lusty courage of ye like
yellow, well-mannered, as having been brought up
amongst the finest and best sort of Devils: having
a pleasant filed tongue, and would make the dainty
Rhetoric come as smoothly out of his mouth as an
arrow out of a piece of paper, well could he talk of
amorous devices, and entreat the bravest Ladies with
sweet entertainment, in truth by report he was a
Gentle-like man, and accomplished with as many
fine parts as a better man than he might justly vaunt
of: he could play upon any fine Instrument, and was
not ignorant of any laudable exercises, carrying a
brave lusty conceit even to his death: and furnished
with many proportions of art, there was nothing wanting
in the man but a Godly mind.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a brave summer Sunshine day, the whole people
of Wittenberg being gathered together, to behold

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span>

certain matches for the Garland who could drink
most, and also to see a match shot at a pair of Butts
with Harquebusiers, as their order is, in a low meadow
hard by the Elve: which now being on his freshest
pride was full of fine and sweet flowers, being in the
latter end of the month, wherein the Sun departs
from the last embracings of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gemini</i>. On a sudden there
was seen a marvellous bright and glorious Rainbow,
spreading the wide arms over the wide World, and
straight was there heard a noise of Trumpets, sounding
a short flourish, and then another, and by and by
another, all alike short, at the which the assembly
was wondrously affeard, and listened, desirous to
see the effect of this wonder and strange miracle,
some of them fell to their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ave Maries</i> lustily, thinking
that the universal Doom had been at that instant,
as thus they beheld with admiration, they might
distinctly perceive a goodly Stage to be reared (shining
to sight like the bright burnish gold) upon many a
fair Pillar of clearest Crystal, whose feet rested upon
the Arch of the broad Rainbow, therein was the high
Throne wherein the King should sit, and that proudly
placed with two and twenty degrees to the top, and
round about curious wrought chairs for divers other
Potentates, there might you see the ground-work at
the one end of the Stage whereout the personated
Devils should enter in their fiery ornaments, made
like the broad wide mouth of an huge Dragon, which
with continual armies of smoke and flame breathed
forth his angry stomach’s rage, round about the eyes
grew hairs not so horrible as men call bristles, but
more horrible as long and stiff spears, the teeth of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span>

this Hell’s mouth far outstretching, and such as a
man might well call monstrous, and more than a man
can by words signify: to be short his hue of that
colour which to himself means sorrow, and to others
ministers like passion: a thick lamp-black, blacker
then any paint, any Hell, blacker than its own self.
At the other end in opposition was seen the place
wherein the bloodless skirmishes are so often performed
on the Stage, the Walls not (so pleasant as old wives
would have their tales adorned with) of Pasty crust,
but Iron attempered with the most firm steel, which
being brightly filed shone as beautifully over the
whole place as the Pale shining Cynthia, environed
with high and stately Turrets of the like metal and
beauty, and hereat many in-gates and out-gates: out
of each side lay the bended Ordnance, shewing at
their wide hollows the cruelty of death: out of
sundry loops many large Banners and Streamers were
pendant, briefly nothing was there wanting that might
make it a fair Castle. There might you see, to be short,
the Gibbet, the Posts, the Ladders, the tiring house,
there everything which in the like houses either use
or necessity makes common. Now above all was there
the gay Clouds <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vsque quaque</i> adorned with the heavenly
firmament, and often spotted with golden tears which
men call Stars: There was lively portrayed the
whole Imperial Army of the fair heavenly inhabitants,
the bright Angels, and such whose names to declare
in so vile a matter were too impious and sacrilegious.
They were so naturally done that you would have
sworn it had been Heaven itself or the Epitome of it,
or some second Heaven, and a new Heaven it was,

from thence like dewy drops wherein the Sun lays his
golden shine, making them to appear like small
golden tears, the sweet odours and comforting liquor
streamed, and seemed always to rain from thence,
but they never fell, but kept a beaten path from down
on high wherein the descending Angel might rejoice.
I should be too long if I should express this rare Stage,
especially in such sort and such-like words as the like
occasion in a more worthy subject would require, but
of necessity we must barely apply our descriptions to
the nature of the whole History. We must not fail
in the first principle of Art, according to that of
Horace.</p>

<p>I shall not need to turn back to declare the deep
astonishment of the people, who are always in most
small manners induced easily to wondering, but now
this excellent fair Theatre erected, immediately after
the third sound of the Trumpets, there entereth in the
Prologue attired in a black vesture, and making his
three obeisances, began to shew the argument of that
Scenical Tragedy, but because it was so far off they
could not understand the words, and having thrice
bowed himself to the high Throne, presently vanished.
Then out of this representance of Hell’s mouth,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 260]</span>

issued out whole Armies of fiery flames, and most
thick foggy smokes, after which entered in a great battle
of footmen Devils, all armed after the best fashion
with pike, etc., marching after the stroke of the courageous
Drum, who girded about laid siege to this fair
Castle, on whose Walls after the summons Faustus
presented himself upon the battlements, armed with a
great number of Crosses, pen and ink horns, charms,
characters, seals, periapts,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> etc., who after sharp
words defied the whole assembly, seeming to speak
earnestly in his own defence, and as they were ready
to rear the Ladders, and Faustus had begun to prepare
for the counterbattery, determining to throw down
upon the assembly’s heads so many heavy charms and
conjurations, that they should fall down half way from
the ascendant, whilst these things began to wax hot
from the aforesaid Heaven, there descended a Legion
of bright Angels riding upon milk-white Chariots,
drawn with the like white steeds, who with celestial
divine melody came into the Town, to the intent to
fight for the Doctor against his furious enemies, but
he wanting pay-money, and void indeed of all good
thoughts, not able to abide their most blessed presence,
sent them away, and they returned from whence they
came, sorrowfully lamenting his most wilful obstinacy,
whilst he had all benointed the Walls with holy Water,
and painted with blood many a crimson Cross. At
length the Alarm was given, and the Ladders cleaved
to the Walls, up the assailants climbed, up they lifted
their fearful weapons. Faustus not able (destitute of
help) to withstand them, was taken prisoner, and his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span>

Tower razed down to the earth, with whose fall both
the large Heaven and World shook and quaked mightily,
whom, when they had fettered, they left there, they
marching out and the fore-named Chairs were presently
occupied with all the Imperial rulers of Hell,
who clothed in their holiday apparel sat there to give
Judgment upon this wilful Faustus, whom two Hangmans
of Hell unloosed, and there in presence of
them all the great Devil afore his chief peers, first
stamping with his angry foot, and then shaking his
great bush of hair, that therewith he made the near
places and the most proud Devils’ courages to tremble,
and with his fire-burnt sceptre, and his like-coloured
Crown, all of gold, setting one arm by his side, and
the other upon the pommel of his Chair, shook a
pretty space with such angry fury, that the flames
which proceeded from his frightful eyes did dim the
sight of the Wittenbergers below. There was in this
said Wittenberg a gallant fair Lady and a virgin,
which now following her mother, accompanied with
sundry gallant German Gentlemen, had even now
entered out of their Barge, and seeing the whole world
of people as they thought gazing up into the Heaven so
very strangely, were partly struck with wonder, some
with fear, and some with sudden merriment, and hasting
down the hill more than a round pace, asked some
what was there to do, and they bid them look up
(for here is to be noted that they looked up afore but
could see nothing, but as always they were wont until
they shewed them it), which they did, and at the same
time wherein the great Devil was in his red-hot anger,
this young Gentlewoman looked up, whose most ugly

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span>

shape so feared her, that even then there she fell
down in a swoon, whom they conveyed away very
speedily, yet ere they could come home she was well-nigh
dead, and so she lay for two years without hope
of life, or certainly of death: great sorrow to her
parents, and as cruel pain to her: But she at length
recovered her Spirit, and if by your patience I may,
I will tell you how. There was a most learned and
excellent Doctor dwelling in the town who had great
knowledge in the black Art, who being requested to
use some Physic to aid her in her great extremity,
being promised for reward five thousand Dollars.
This Doctor perceiving the cause of her malady was
not caused of any distemperature of her body, but
only of the aforesaid fear, knew that Physic might well
make her body sound, but her mind never. Wherefore
not only for the reward, but also to become
gracious and famous at once, proceeded in his cure on
this manner. One night having made his Orisons and
nine times combed his hair with tears of a pure maid,
and nine times gone about a fire made all of pure
Heben<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> coal, and thrice nine times called upon the name
of the most dreadful Hecate, he laid himself to sleep
upon a pure white and clean unspotted maiden’s
smock, and covered himself over with the ashes of
a white Hind roasted and burned altogether, he slept,
and the next morning apparelled in white robes,
having often and often called, recalled and exorcised
the three Fairies Millia, Achilya, and Sybilla, at
length the ground opened, and with them they brought
a milk-white Steed, and did put upon his finger the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span>

ring of invisibility; when they were vanished, he
mounted up upon his Horse, who with more swift
flight then the winged Pegasus carried him through
the wide Air so fast and so long, that having passed
over Bohem, Hungary, Thracia, all Asia Minor,
Mesopotamia, and at length to Arabia Felix, where
he alighted upon a most high Mountain, all the way
from the top to the bottom of a just breadth and steepness,
so that he that were on that would think himself
not in the world, and they beneath would deem him
to be in Heaven, upon the brims of it round about
grew the high Pines, the stately Cedars, and always
so green as the most fresh Meadow: the height of
this huge rock was two and twenty miles in even
altitude and half a mile of just circuit all the way:
there he tied his Horse to a Tree and knocked at
the Castle gate, where afore was never seen any, so
that no path could there be seen, so that a man might
justly have called it the house of little Hospitality, to
him there came Neglectment, an old Lady, and
demanded what he would, who told her his errand,
and withal a ring of fine gold from the three Fairies;
she knew the ring and his errand, and conveyed him
into many a fair room, wherein she shewed him many
a worthy Knight’s memorials, many an antique
Monument heaped up, but inner rooms so monstrous
dark and nightly, that no human eye could perceive anything,
and forth she brought him unto a Garden, out
of the midst whereof rose a little Hill, from the summit
whereof there was a paved way of pure Crystal stone,
from along whose bosom trilled a small Water: This
water an old man held, and indeed he had it as a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 264]</span>

Patrimony, for therefore he could shew many an
ancient evidence, and worn Charter, his hair was all
fled to his front, as if some enemy had scared the hinder
locks from his scalp, on his back hung a pair of Wings
which flagged down, as if either they had been broken
or he weary, and thus he overstrode a round World,
from out of every part whereof gushed out this small
River which was conveyed down in this Crystal pipe,
in his hand he held a long scythe, and in the other an
hour-glass, here the Doctor seeing the old ruins of
this sumptuous house, and all the fair Walls and
buildings over-grown with a deadly Moss, was much
amazed, but because he could not tarry, he dipped
a small Vial in the spring and departed, and for
because he was so peremptorily warned not to tarry,
he could not behold the most stately Galleries, in
which he might see the World’s chief pleasures and
Monuments, some wholly worn away, some half, and
some even now beginning, and some wholly quite
over-grown with a thick earthy fur, for as he came by
an old Wall he chanced with his elbow to rub off the
thick Moss, and then might he see a fair piece of
Parchment gilded and painted curiously, wherein
was truly described the ancient tokens of a most brave
and worthy Gentleman, so having sped of his journey
he came by the same way again as he went, Neglectment
shut the doors upon him, whilst he mounted
upon his white swift-footed Horse and by the like
time arrived at his own house, where having with the
blood of a new-slain heifer, thrice anointed the feet
of his Cavallo, and tying at his ear with a string of
fine silk spun by the hands of a pure maid, the received

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 265]</span>

ring of invisibility unto his ear, with many a Cross,
and many an open <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ave Maria</i>, dismissed him, who
in the same moment returned to the place from whence
he came. With this water the Doctor came to the maid,
and having used a certain incantation, gave her to
drink of the water of deep Oblivion, which she had
no sooner tasted of, but straightways she had forgotten
the terrible picture of the Devil, and was revived out
of all her infernal fears, the Doctor called, winning
him credit, favour, and fame, and richly rewarded for
his medicine, departed, and running home threw his
Vial into the deep River burying oblivion with oblivion,
the parents of the young Lady rejoicing exceedingly
at their daughter’s recovery, for ever after caused the
place wherein their daughter was thus scared, to be
inaccessible for man or beast, compassing it in with
a high wall, and overthrowing the banks, so that
now there is no mention of the meadow nor of the
Wall.</p>

<p>The Devil, the great Devil Lucifer having finished
his brief Oration, descended down out of his Judgment
seat, and pointing unto all his Nobles, took Faustus
by the hand, and placed him just before him, taking
him by the chin, seemed to them to bid him speak
freely, he mounted up again unto his high Throne,
and with a more mild madness expected the speech
of the Doctor, who having bowed himself submissively
unto these damnable company, he began to
speak, and yet not long, then he began to walk up and
down and to shew strange gestures, when suddenly for
some bug’s-words<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> escaped by Faustus, all the Devils<span class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span>
there rose up, and with their swords drawn threatening
with them the poor Doctor, turning all their
bodies and directing their faces to the King, who
with a stern countenance commanded silence. When
Faustus having long raged, of a sudden howling loud,
and tearing his hair, laid both his arms upon his neck,
and leaped down headlong off the stage, the whole
company immediately vanishing, but the stage, with
a most monstrous thundering crack followed Faustus
hastily, the people, verily thinking that they would
have fallen upon them, ran all away, and he was happiest
that had the swiftest foot, some leaped into the
River and swam away, and all of them with great
affright ran into the City and clapped the City gates
together, straight, and to increase this fear they thought
they heard a thing fall into the river as if a thousand
houses had fallen down from the top of Heaven into it.
But afterwards this was known to be Wagner’s knavery,
who did this to shew the Pursuivant some point of
his skill.</p>

<h3 id="SR_CHAP_IX">CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> messenger had not tarried above three days, when
as Wagner had trussed up his baggage, and was now
ready to depart, when on the third day at night he
caused his boy Artur Harmarvan (who was the son of
a wealthy boor, witty above many, and praised for his
notable waggery: his father dwelt at Malmesburg a
town hard by Wittenberg in Saxony in high Dutchland,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 267]</span>

with whom Wagner being acquainted had obtained
him of his father to serve him, and he to be
taught of Wagner), him he caused to go to divers
scholars of his acquaintance, to sup with him at his
departure, who being invited to this hated farewell,
came speedily, where they had a banquet and other
courtesies which in such a time both custom and laws
of their fellowship do prescribe: In the supper time
the scholars moved many questions, and amongst
the rest, one desired the Pursuivant to describe unto
them his Lord and master, for they heard say that
the Duke Alphonsus was a marvellous qualified
Gentleman: The Pursuivant not willing to refuse
their request told them that seeing their demand
proceeded of a common good zeal, he could not but
wrongfully refuse to satisfy: notwithstanding the
truth might be better known of another than of him,
when duty bids to be partial, if any defect might
breed partiality, but so much as I will tell you, the
enemy will not disdain to affirm: And there he told
them the very stature, proportion, and particular
lineaments, concluding that he shewed the uprightness
of his mind by the proportion of his body, and keeping
in his outward shape, the virtue which philosophers
would have kept in the mind. There he told them the
feature of his countenance, the colour of his hair, eyes,
face, cheeks, etc. He told them his stature, favour,
and strength, which was such, that with pure cleanness
of his force, he hath foiled a gentleman in wrestling,
who beside whiteness of body, was very firm without
affection, not as some do which in performing anything
will with such a ridiculous sourness act it, as if the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 268]</span>

force of the body must be personated upon the Theatre
of his face: He declared unto them that the gifts of
his mind were such as then he could not for the number
reckon up, but even as occasion should serve might
meet with them, being all such as were more ready
to be admired than imitated, as if all virtues were
gathered in him together, magnanimity, magnificence,
affability, modesty, etc., briefly (he said) there were in
him all those Graces, which adorn the subject with the
title of Virtuous. He likewise recounted unto them
his studies, unto which he accommodated himself at
vacant hours, were partly the Poetry. A Poem of his
he said he had by chance gotten (and by greater
chance had it there at that instant) which he had made
in praise of his excellent Lady when he was but of
young years, his Father living, I dare say he would
not for ten thousand florins have it seen, being such
a one as on a dreaming passion he had let fall from
his pen, and of many the most abject, but such as this
is deserves commendations, because a Prince made it,
but if you saw his real devices, you would then say
they were Prince-like. And then he read it, which I
was loath, my good friends, either to translate or
translated to present it here, for that it was not worthy
your censure, considering the nice buildings of Sonnets
nowadays, but according to Ariosto’s vein you shall
find it very conformable, as also for that I knew that
if I should have left it out, it would have been more
wished for than now admired. Yet for that I prefer
your well-known good wills afore any vain fear, take
this with the rest, if they be any with such favour, as
if I were by you at the reading.</p>

<p>This Sonnet was ended with as much praise as it
began with desire, and one of them copied it out, and
so it was made common to the rest, and made a good
sort of them Poets, rectifying their gross conceits,
with so sweet a matter. He told them that this was
but a preparative to wondering in respect of his choice
makings. Then he shewed them this Epigram, which
he made when as before the Duke his Father, a brace
of fair English Greyhounds fell down at the Hart’s
heels stark dead (the Hart also lying not above six
yards off dead too) with chasing, having outstripped
the rest of the dogs above half a mile.</p>

<p>Then he reckoned unto him the delight he took in
Limning, and shewed them very many fine devices of
his own handiwork. The scholars singularly delighted
with the view of the reliques of so great a Prince,
approved by silence that excellency which by speech
they could not. In fine there he reckoned up enough
to be praised, and peradventure more than was true,
but not more than is desired. There he set forth
with great and ardent Emphasis other qualities, as his
skill and hardy demeanour at the Tilt tourney, how he
could manage the sturdy steed, leap, run, vaunt,
dance, sing, play on divers Instruments, and talk with
amiable speech amongst fair Ladies which we call
courting, in all his actions full of gentle familiar
affability, still reserving to himself the due honour
belonging to his personage. He concluded in fine that
he was the most qualified Prince and absolute Gentleman
that day in all Christendom: saying if they knew
his humanity, justice and liberality, you would say
in him were all humanity, justice and liberality;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 271]</span>

And as the greatest thing that the world can shew is
beauty, so the least thing that is to be praised in him
is beauty, you would say no less than I have spoken
could be in his person, if you did but see him. Thus
far the digression came in the commendations of this
Alphonsus, which truly I was weary of, fearing the
great insufficiency of the description, but yet he had
not done. I would to God (quoth he) you would
come to Vienna and I promise you such lodging and
entertainment, that next to the sight of him should be
worthiest of your thanks. Wherefore you shall not
sorrow that your friend Wagner departeth unless you
will seem to envy rather his felicity than his departure.
I would we were even all of us as we sit at the Table
in the Duke’s Court, and here again with a wish, and
herewith there knocked one at the door, Wagner
craftily feigning that he himself would rise to see him
that knocked so, desiring them all to sit still in any
case, and opening therewith the door, there entered
two young Lords of Tergeste and Moravia, bearing
torches, and next there came the Duke of Austrich,
as they thought, and Wagner talked with him bare-headed
(the Pursuivant, thinking verily it had been
his Master, would have done his duty unto him, but
that the rest hindered him): on his head he wore a
little Hat of blue velvet, with a rich band of pearl,
stone and gold, and a long white feather, his cloak of
blue velvet, round guarded with gold lace, edged with
Orient pearl, and betwixt the gards oylet<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> holes whereout
hung by small silk threads long bugles, all the
sleeves in the like order: by his side a golden-hilted

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 272]</span>

Rapier, and on his Rapier his hand, his Buskins of
the fine Polonian leather, richly embroidered on the
turnings down with costly Goldsmith’s work, all his
apparel whatsoever most beautiful and princely, he
had no sooner passed by (which was not until he was
distinctly viewed of them) but that Wagner spake
unto them in such manner: saying that that Honourable,
this man’s Lord had sent for him, whose commandment
I will in no wise repugn. Wherefore I
beseech you to take it as you would my greatest advancement.
This his description of his feature,
judge how rightly he hath said, for my part I confess
that they are rather less than the truth, than not as he
hath reported, and herein to satisfy you the more,
I have caused my spirit Akercocke to take his shape
upon him.</p>

<p>Now (quoth he) it is time to depart, but because it
shall be the last night of our meeting, none of you shall
depart, for I have lodging enough for you all, and for
you shall not be forgetful of Wagner when he is gone,
let every man wish his woman, and so to bed my
masters. They began all to laugh merrily, not as
hoping or wishing, but as if they had heard a merry
purpose, and therefore they laughed because it was
merry, and such mirth they always liked of. Wagner
was almost angry, and yet for that he was almost,
he was not angry, sending out a great oath as the
Prologue of his Comedy, bidding his Boy go prepare
their beds and chambers, and bid them wish
whom they would, he would their wishes should be
performed. Then rose up one of the scholars persuading
himself of Wagner’s earnest, and yet doubting,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 273]</span>

because he feared he was not in earnest. Why (quoth
he) if you mean in very deed, my friend Kit, I would
I had such a woman, I believe beside herself there is
none fairer then the fairest in this town. Why weenest
thou I jest (quoth Wagner), go thy ways, yonder she
is upon pain of my head, and so it was indeed: then
everyone strove who should wish first, and he that
wished last had his first wish, so everyone took his
Damsel and for that night departed to their beds, who
are witnesses of that night’s great pleasures, and in
the morning they arose wishing that every morning
were the morrow of such a night. Every one gat
him a Hackney, and brought him on the way a day’s
journey, where they with great grief left him, who
rode till he came to Vienna, and they till they arrived
at Wittenberg. Thus still you see these Pot-meetings
are ended amongst these puffed-cheeked Hannikins<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
with bed dalliances, rightly describing their lives
most bestial and Epicure-like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> long after it was reported and blazed abroad that
Wagner was departed, divers Scholars guessing that
he had left his Books or the most part behind, determined
to send for Harmarvan, which they did, who by

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 274]</span>

no persuasions could be won to let them have his
master’s Keys, so they devised amongst themselves to
bind the Boy as he should go home to his Inn, whereat
his Master had put him to board till his return. And
night drawing on, Harmarvan went to his lodging,
by the way Scholars to the number of seven met him
and bound him, and beat him sore until he gave them
all the Keys, which he carefully carried about him
sewed in a wide German slop,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> which when they had
(they being all muffled and disguised strangely with
vizards) they loosed, and then they ran hastily to
Wagner’s house, as if they had fled from followers, or
else followed some hastily flying, where being come,
they opened the gates, and being entered shut them
again, this being about eleven of the clock in ye night,
and in they went, where they found two Barrels of
mighty strong March English Beer of two years old,
which they broached, and sat so long drinking till
they were all well drunk. And then down they get
into a back Court, and having lighted Tapers, having
injuriously framed all the circles, squares, triangles,
etc., and apparelled with all the conjuring robes that
the Art requireth, there they begin in a most dreadful
confusion of hellish syllables to inform the Fiend, and
after these words followed as if there needs must such
things follow after such words, a terrible roar, and then
so bright a smothering thick fiery fume ascended out
of the earth as if it would have made an eternal night,
then a vehement flame followed which with continual
motion, ran about the brims of the circle, until as
weary it left moving (all this while they continued

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span>

reasonably constant, and continued their invocations
without any fear), then from beneath was heard most
lamentable outcries, from above huge trembling,
thunder, and round about nothing but fear and death
in a thousand diverse shapes, then they began to
quail a little, but yet by encouragement grew hardy by
reason of the number, then round about was sounded
alarms with drums, and on set with Trumpets, as if
there all the World had conflicted, then ye flame which
all this while ran about the circle became a body, but
such a body, as, if it had been but a Picture, would
have madded anyone. At whose sight they wholly
overcome with deadly fear forgot the use of their
Pentacles or any such gear, but even submitted themselves
to the small mercy of the Fiend, who with
great violence rent them and tore them most lamentably.
Harmarvan who had raised a great many to the
intent to follow them suspecting that which indeed
was, was after long wandering (for they had caused
a Devil descryer to void all within a certain circuit)
with his company brought to the house, where round
about they might see in the Court wherein these
seven were conjuring, huge flames as if some great
pile had been made to the burial of a noble Hero,
climbing up in huge volumes up into the Air, or if
some great store of stubble had been fired, so vehemently
furious was the flame that no man there (and
there were above thirty) was able once to draw near
to any part of ye House, the cry was carried into the
City of this fire, whereupon the whole town was
assembled with hooks, buckets, ladders, etc., where
in vain they emptied many a large Well, till divers

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span>

learned Preachers falling down submissively on their
knees, with good faith appeased this seeming fire which
indeed was none, but a mere diabolical illusion, then
they entered into the house, where they found the
Barrels brought a bed and delivered, the cups, the
whole furniture clean destroyed, broken, and thrown
about the House, but drawing near unto the most
rueful and lamentable spectacle of all, coming into the
yard or grove which was moated about and enclosed
with a thick Wall of trees very exceeding high, as
Fir trees are, so very thick that no light was pierceable
into it, in the very midst whereof was a round plot
of some one hundred foot any way from the Centre,
there found they the religious Circles, there the strange
Characters, names of Angels, a thousand Crosses,
there found they the five cross hilted Daggers for the
five Kings of Hell, there many a strong bulwark
builded with rows of Crosses, there found they the
surplices, the stoles, pall, mitres, holy water pots
broken, their periapts, seats, signs of the Angels of
the seven days, with infinite like trash and damnable
roguery, the fruits of the Devil’s rank fancy. But the
most lamentable sight of all, the seven Scholars utterly
torn in pieces, their blood having changed the colour
of the ground into a dark Crimson, all their bodies as
black as any coal, as if they had been scorched with
a material fire, their flesh violently rent from the bones,
and hanging down in morsels like the skirts of a side-coat,
their bones all broken, their veins cut in sunder,
and their bowels broad shed upon the earth, their
brains poured out and covering the red grass all over,
their noses stumped, their eyes thrust out, their

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 278]</span>

mouths widened and slit up to the ears, their teeth
dashed out, and their tongues starting out betwixt
their gums, their hair clean singed off, in brief imagine
with yourselves in your minds, and propound a picture
in your thought, the most deformed, torn, and ill-favoured
that you can think on, yet shall it not compare
to the most lachrimable sight and shew of them,
surpassing as much all credit as my skill duly to describe
them, whom when they had buried without
tarriance, razed the house to the ground, and filled
up the moats with earth, heaping upon the place of
this murther the stones of the house defaced, then they
returned home discoursing with lamentable judgment
upon the high and severe revenge of God’s indignation
upon them which durst presume to tempt his
glorious Majesty. And finally, unless repentance
breed a more speedy remorse, such is the fatal end of
such proud attempts. And surely this is most true,
for I myself have seen the ground where the house
stood, and yet the moats dammed up and the Water
breaking through the stones even to this day, there
did I see a skull and a shank bone of them not yet
rotten: and there did I see the huge heap of stones
wherewith they are covered, a fearful example of
God’s wrath and justice against such infidel Christians.</p>

as many victories in his sword as some
Emperors in their thoughts, arrived at length afore

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</span>

Vienna, having made his preamble with the destroying
and burning of the country before him, thinking upon
the ancient politic rule, <i>Better it is to have a spoiled
country than a lost</i>, with a brave prepared Army of
two hundred thousand Saracens, horse and foot, and
so many it is certain he had, because they doubted not
but there were 300,000. The mighty Cham having
erected his royal Pavilions, and entrenched himself
to besiege the noble Vienna, munified his camp with
Artillery and deep ditches, and then he sent a Letter
of defiance unto the honourable Alphonsus, as being
principal in his own City, who was environed within
the walls of the City expecting the day of battle, for
to this intent the states of Italy and the Emperor of
Germany, with the Dukes of Saxony, Bavaria, and the
other Provinces near assembled (for now necessity
bred unity) with a brave company of Soldiers to
exterminate this monster out of their confines: unto
the Duke of Austrich only (for he had no intelligence
of their assembled forces) he directed his Letters with
defiance, meaning to conclude his long travails with
a certain victory; fearing neither the peril which so
many gallant soldiers thoroughly resolved might bring,
nor that ever God or fortune (as they call it) would
once shew him any disfavour, whose only favour is
only in show. Nor yet that the heaven’s great God
would not with severe revengement chastise the
Leviathan’s insolency and slaughter of so many
Martyrs, rather deferring than forgetting so just a
punishment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> this time the Messenger and Wagner arrived at
Vienna very late in the night and passed through
the Turkish Sentinels, and arriving at the City, and
for that night they lay at the Pursuivant’s house; no
sooner had the approaching Sun sent afore him the
Marshals of the morrow light, and a new morning
ministered occasion of new matter, but up those two
arose and being ready departed for the Court, and now
the day was almost in the greatest beauty, when the
Messenger was admitted into the Duke’s presence,
unto whom he recited whatever was seen and done
in that time of his absence (only I forgot to tell you
how Wagner raged and stormed, and thundered,
when Akercocke brought him word of the destruction
of his House at Wittenberg as he was in the way to
Austria), wherewith the Duke was wonderfully both
delighted and astonished. And having welcomed
Wagner very graciously and accordingly rewarded,
he dismissed them till further leisure, commanding
the Pursuivant to shew him all the pleasure he mought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> all these most excellent Princes
were come into the counsel chamber, the Herald sounded his trumpet
after the Turkish summons, then did all the states draw into the Great
Hall, wherein a high Imperial throne richly ordered with shining cloth
of Gold,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>

every noble and estate placed correspondently to his
degree, where in presence of them all the Herald was
admitted, who coming with his coat of Arms lying
upon his right arm into the bottom of the Hall, made
three obeisances down with the right knee unto the
ground, with a loud and distinct voice spake unto the
Duke only, telling him that his sovereign and Master
Sultan Alias Chan, the son of Murad Chan, the son
of Rabeck Chan, the son of Mahomet Chan, and so
upwards till he came to their great Prophet Mahomet,
God on the earth, and Emperor of all the East. And
then he began to reckon five hundred titles, with a long
etc.... Unto thee Alphonsus Arch-Duke of Austrich,
and there he declared the whole effects of his
message, and at last with a great Bravado ended, and
then he did on his gay coat of Arms, expecting their
answer. When as the Duke craving licence of the
Emperor to speak, answered ye Herald in most gallant
and triumphing terms, commanding him to say unto
the proud Turk his Master, that ere five days came
about, he would trample his victorious horns under
his feet, and ride in triumph upon his stubborn neck,
and that in defence of himself and of brave Christendom
he would leese<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
the uttermost drop of his blood,
and to make it good he would not be in quiet till he had
met his Master in the midst of the field, and therewith
he drew out his sword, and all they with him, crying
God and Saint Michael for the right of Christendom:
then stood up the Emperor and avowed all that they
had said afore him, commanding moreover the Herald
to say to the proud Usurper, that seeing the quarrel

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span>

would breed great effusion of blood, and yet he never
the nearer, that he a man every way equal to himself,
not only for the speedier advance of his battles, but
also to have a certain end to such an uncertain enterprise,
he would fight with him body to body, armed at
all points after their own guise at any time within this
fortnight, and Herald, bring me word (quoth he)
that he will so do, and by my Honour I promise to
give thee for thy tidings 10,000 Ducats. Then the
Herald being highly rewarded was dismissed, and
reported their brave answers unto the Turk, with all
the great majesty of the Christian Princes, who presently
went to counsel together, and so continued till
other like necessary business called them away.</p>

was wanting, and the other part so rent that it could
not be read, yet by some circumstances I conjecture
that the Duke of Austrich had divers and dangerous
conflicts with the Turk, yet being supported by the
English men and other Christians, with the help of
Wagner, who standing in a high tower to see the conflicts,
caused by his Magic such a storm to arise that
no man was able to abide, the Turk was still discomfited.</p>

<div class="center"><i>The gifts of Wagner to the Duke, and three Devils
retained for Soldiers to the same Prince</i>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the next morning Wagner presented himself to
the Duke in presence of all the whole Princes of the
Christians, whom very graciously he entertained as
he might for his good service, and there in presence
of them all he desired the Duke to take at his servant’s
hands a small gift, which he condescended unto, and
then Wagner caused a Chest to be brought in of fine
Iron, wrought and enamelled with gold and colour
most curiously, then he opened it and took out a
whole armour of fine bright steel so light as a common
Doublet, but so subtly and excellently framed, that
it passed all comparison of hardness, there was a
Musket shot at every piece whereon remained no great
notice of a blow, but as of a little touch, plain without
any broider work or otherwise carved, but so exceeding
bright as would well have dazzled the
long beholder’s eyes, a shield of the same fashion,
made like a tortoise shell, a sword of the like fine temper,
with all the furniture of a soldier, then took he out
a Plume which he had no sooner put into the crest, but
he that stood behind could not see no part of his back,
nor he that stood before of his breast, so that thus it
made him invisible, there he told him it was fetched
out of the great Turk’s armoury, which they say
was Mahomet’s, but I say more truly Alias Chan’s,
which for himself caused it to be made, having called

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 284]</span>

together the most excellent Philosophers and workmen
that were to be found in all his wide Empire. The
great rewards the Duke would have given him for it
he refused, he was only contented with thanks and
favour. And then might they see from the door of
the chamber three most gallant men to enter, which
were his three Familiars, whom Wagner taking by
the hands presented unto the whole assembly of
Princes, but more directly to the Duke, assuring them
that they were the most fortunate, most valiant,
strong, hardy, and puissant men that in the World
were to be found, and indeed they seemed to be as
goodly swart men as any eye beheld, he told their
several names: Mephostophiles he termed Mamri,
Akercocke he termed Simionte, Faustus he called
Don Infeligo, shewing that they were born in those
fortunate Islands, wherein the Poets feigned the
Elysian fields to be, joining by West upon the end of
Barbary, being from Vienna to those fortunate Islands
35 degrees of longitude and eight minutes, and 48
degrees and 22 minutes from the Equator or Equinoctial,
in latitude not then found out. So were they
most graciously entertained of all the Nobles, and
entertained in the Duke’s most Honourable pay.
Wagner said that they three left their country and
sought adventures, and by chance coming this way,
I knowing of it by secret intelligence, met them and
certainly assured of their high valours, thought good
to shew them to you, for he that first had spoke to
them had been first served, nor cared they whether
to serve us or the Infidel.</p>
<hr class="chap">

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<h3 id="SR_CHAP_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I spake</span> before of a challenge made by the Emperor
unto the Turk, which when the Herald had reported
unto the Sultan (who certainly was a very honorable
Soldier) but there he vowed to perform it, and to set
the Emperor’s head upon the highest pavilion in view
of all the City. And thereupon the next day after this
skirmish, he sent the same Herald with purpose and
commandment to declare in excellent gallant terms
the acceptance of the combat, knowing that it depended
upon his honour to shew his small fear, in not refusing
so equal a Foe, whose proffer proceeded from a most
Honourable resolution: when it was reported unto the
Emperor that the same Herald returned, he caused the
Hall to be adorned with most brave furniture, his high
Chair of estate placed, and all about seats for the other
Princes. The Emperor having seated himself, full
of brave thought and gallant hardihood, expecting the
answer of the enemy in such sort as it was in very deed.
In all brave manner the Herald in proud phrase uttered
the purport of his message, requesting that a peace
being concluded on both parties for the space of three
days, and free egress and regress for the Nobles on
both parties, the one to view the Camp, the other the
Court, and on the third day he would, armed in his
country manner, meet him in the lists, to shew that
he never refused the combat of any Christian Emperor,
albeit he knew his calling far superior to that of his.
So then the message was accepted, the Herald had his
10,000 Ducats carried to the Turk’s camp on horse,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</span>

and they in the City began to keep feasts, and entertained
the Turkish Nobles in exceeding bravery, and
they theirs in the like without damage or thought of
treason.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h3 id="SR_CHAP_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the time of this truce, these four companions,
Infeligo, Wagner, Mamri, Simionte, cast how to abuse
the great Turk most notably, and Akercocke otherwise
called Simionte he would begin first, and lead them
the dance. Then he leaves them and gets me up
unseen to the Turk’s Camp, and in his Camp to his
own Pavilion, and so into the place where the great
Infidel himself sat, he being then gone into the Lavatory,
which is a place wherein he three times a day
doth bathe himself, which by so doing he doth verily
believe that all his sins are remitted and washed away,
be they never so horrible, Devilish, or wicked, then
Akercocke or Simionte, which ye will, goes invisibly
into the Lavatory where the great Villain was bathing
himself amongst three of his most fair Concubines
stark naked, swimming as much in their dalliance as
in the water, mingling his washing with kisses and his
cleansing with voluptuousness, Akercocke in the shape
of a bright Angel appears unto him, and with a proud
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">magnifico</i> presented himself unto the slave, who
straightways very reverently fell down upon his knees,
and with his hands high lifted up, worshipped towards
him in great humility, whilst Akercocke with good
devotion fell aboard the Concubines, and there acted
them before his face one after another: when he had so

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span>

done, he takes the great slave by the tip of his picke-devant,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
and shaking him fiercely (who all this while
with great dread and fear lay half astonished and all
naked on the ground), told him that he had prepared
a more braver place for his so good a servant than so
base a bath, and no fairer Concubines. (Now the
Turk had seen how like a lusty rank fellow this Simionte
had behaved himself, at which he wondered not
greatly, because Faustus whom he thought to have
been Mahomet, as well as he did think Akercocke,
had also shewed the virtue of so great a God as
Mahound, twenty times more beauty than Jupiter.)
Then the Turkish Emperor with half-dying hollow
voice, as if his breath had been almost gone or else
but now coming, said that he was all at his commandment,
and so followed Simionte stark naked as he was
born, who led him by the hand round about, and
through every Lane and place of his Camp, to the great
wonderment and laughter of his people, who verily
thought Mahound had commanded him to do penance
before he fought with the Christian Emperor. But
for all this the people fell into such laughter that some
had well-nigh given up the Ghost at the same instant,
divers Christian Nobles saw him all this while, who
effusedly laughed at so apparent foolery. The Turk
for all this not moved, for indeed he heard all and saw
nothing, went about wonderfully mannerly: like as
you shall see a Dutch Frow, with a handkerchief in
her hand, mince it after ye hopping German. Could
a man devise a more notorious kind of abuse, than to
make that man which will not be seen but in great

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 288]</span>

secrecy, and abundantly and richly clad, to be not
only seen openly but also stark naked, and become their
laughing-stocks whose terror he is always, but Akercocke
had not yet so left him, but down he runs to
Danuby, (where there was ready Mamri or Mephostophiles
to receive him), and there having turned
himself and the vilest part of himself to the Turk’s
mouth, making him kiss and kiss it again, he took him
and hurled him violently into the Water, and then
Akercocke vanished away.</p>

shame would have drowned himself in very deed, had
not Mamri come swiftly flying over and gave him a
terrible blow on the noddle with a good Bastinado,
that he almost made his brains fly out, and rapt him
up by his long hair out of the water unto the land, where
he buffeted him so long till at length he came to himself
again, then Mamri fewtered himself to abuse him
kindly, and there with sweet and compassionative
speech comforted him, desiring his reverend Majesty
not to take any grief seeing it was done in the sight
of all his men, in the knowledge of none. And therewith
to shew ye more pity of his misery, he seemed to
shed abundance of tears, desiring him to go with him
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 290]</span>and he would put upon him his soft raiment. The
Turk (who then had his crown upon his head or else
it had not been half in the right <i>Qu</i><a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>),
seeing one
lamenting his case so affectionately, condescended
unto him and promised him most large honourable
promotion and reward. Mamri set him upon his legs
and led him to a little muddy place by the river-side,
and there varnished the Emperor over with most
thick, terrible, and excremental mud, not sparing
either his face, nose, eyes, mouth, nor any thing,
whilst he miserable man thought he had been in most
divine contentment. Thus he led him in the view of
five thousand people (for here is to be noted that all
that ever saw him both knew him to be the great
villain Turk, and could not but laugh most entirely
at him, nor his own men could do any other, nor once
think of any rescue or remedy, by the working of
infernal instinct), until he came to Vienna, and in
Vienna to the most fair gates and where greatest
resort of people are always together, there at the City
gate he drew out a long tabor and a pipe and struck
up such a merry note, as the foolish ornament of all
London stages never could come near him, no not
when he waked the writer of the news out of Purgatory
with the shrill noise. There at the gate stood a Carpenter,
who was then carrying a Coffin to a certain
house to bury one in, him Mephostophiles beat till
he lay on the cold ground, and took the Coffin and
caused the Turk to hold it in his hand. <i>Memorandum</i>
that none of all these Spirits were seen of any one, but
felt of them which saw them. Then from the gate

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</span>

he began to play, the Turk and the Coffin skipped and
turned, and vaulted, and bounded, and leaped, and
heaved, and sprung so fast and so thick together, that
the Coffin rapping the miserable man sometime on
the shins, breast, thighs, head, face, that the dirty
colour was almost wiped away with the streams of
blood. At this strange sight and the unheard noise
of that kind of Instrument, all the boys, girls, and
rogues in the town were gathered with this troupe,
and with this mirth he conveyed them round about the
streets, and all the way as they went, such eggs, such
chamber-pots’ emptyings, such excrements, odoure,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
water, etc., were thrown down on their heads, that it
seemed all those vile matters were reserved for that
Tempest, until such time (then it being about two of
the clock in the afternoon when everyone is busied in
some pleasant pastance<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>),
as all this fair company
came to the Court, whereout at divers windows lay
the chiefest of all the Nobility, and the most brave
Gentlewomen, who seeing such a huge crowd of Boys,
the great Turk and a Coffin dancing, and a tabor and
pipe played upon, they were almost amazed, thus he
marched finely round about the whole Court, till
coming to the Court gate he entered in (but the Boys
were excluded), with this merry Morris there in
presence of them all, the Turk fell down dead, whom
Mamri laid in the Coffin, and then vanished away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Wagner seeing him grieved, came and kneeled
down before him, declaring that he would undertake
to heal all his wounds and other grievances whatsoever,
yea and make him utterly forget all that was passed
as if it had never been, and promised more to carry
him home himself safe and sound, which the Emperor
thanked him highly for, requesting him to perform
it presently, for he would not for half his revenues
that his Foe should have any occasion to allege against
him, for to excuse the Combat. Then went Wagner
up into his chamber, and apparelled himself in white
taffeta made close to his body, and there where they
use to wear round hose half a foot deep, stuck with
swans’ feathers, like the skirts of a horseman’s coat,
his hose, shoes (for all were together) of the same white
taffeta, and within with white leather, at his heels
two fine silver wings, and on his shoulders two marvellous
large bright silvery wings, and on his head
an upright little steeple hat (with a white feather of
two or three ranges) of white taffeta, and in his hand
a Caduceus or a Mercurial Rod in the same white
silver colour, he entered into the Presence Chamber
afore all the assembly to their singular contentation,
for in his Personated garments he seemed to be a very
Angel, for it was in doubt whether Mercury was half
so beautiful or no. And there opening a large casement
(as there they are very large) with a brave
R’ingratio<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> departed from them taking up his flight<span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span>
in the view of them all into the air, as if he would
have beaten the Azure firmament with his vast wings.
Thus he carried him lower and lower till he did light
upon a great Elm, and there he opened his sight to
see in what plight he was. The Turk seeing in what
a trance he had been, began to swear, to ban and
curse, and was even then ready to have thrown himself
down headlong, but Mercury he stepped to him and
bade him be of good cheer, for it had pleased the great
God Jupiter, whose servant Mahomet was, to shew
him those great abuses, to the intent he should be
more wary in his actions, and take heed how to tempt
the Christians with vain battles and such-like speech,
but now (quoth he) come and give me thy hand, and
then will I lead thee to thy Pavilion, where as yet
thou art not missed of the Nobles, for in the place
where thou wast taken away, hath Jove sent one to
bear thy shape. Then again he took his flight and all
the way as he went he rapped his heels against the tops
of the high trees, and beat him pitifully upon the
shins all the journey, upon the tents’ tops. Now they
arrived in the same place from whence he was taken,
and there he laid himself down who presently recovered
his former strength in full perfectness, and not only
not felt it but utterly forgot it. Then he continued
his wonted solace and prepared himself to the battle,
whilst he was made a laughing-stock of the world,
Wagner returned through ye same path which he had
made in the air before, came not yet to the Court
before they had done laughing, for there the matter
from the beginning to the end was rehearsed.</p>

<div class="center"><i>The process to the Combat</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two days of the truce were passed and the third
morning was come, in which time many gallant feats
of arms and activity were performed on both parts.
Now the time of the combat was come. There was
in the River of Danuby a pretty Island of a quarter
of a mile long or more, as even as ground might be
all the way, in this place were the lists prepared, and
a scaffold richly hanged for the Judges to determine
in. In the evening about four of the clock (being
then reasonably cool) the Christian Emperor issued
out with above 100,000 Christians, the rest being
above 60,000 were left to defend the City (for both
the Christian and especially the Turks were increased)
where he entered into the wide plain, and coming to
the bank’s side he entered into a broad Ferry boat
leaving his whole Army on the other side of the River
whilst he laboured to attain to the Island. The Duke
of Austria with his attendants Mamri, Simionte,
Infeligo, and Wagner, the Dukes of Cleve, Saxony,
Campany, and Brabant, with the like number all
bravely and gloriously mounted: The Duke of Austria
in his bright armour marshalled the field, and of the
Christians sat as Judges the kings of Lusitany and
Arragon with their Heralds: Now the Emperor is
landed in the Island and is mounted into his rich saddle,
armed in armour so costly, strong, curious, and resplendescent,
that it seemed all the beauty in the world had

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 296]</span>

been gathered together in it, his courser so firm, nimbly
jointed, tall and large, such a one might have been the
son of Gargantua’s mare for his Giant-like proportion.
Then took he his strong and large Ashen lance, bearing
in his steel head Iron death, at the top whereof hung
a fair and rich pennon, the whole shaft of the spear
double gilded over and curiously enamelled, about
his neck hung his horn shield, artificially adorned with
his own achievements, the belt whereon his sword
hung of beaten gold, his caparison of pure cloth of
gold, whereon the rich stones were so ordinary that
they took away ye glittering of the metal only as if it
had been the Sunbeams, trailed along betwixt precious
gutters. On his helmet was fixed a rich Crown of the
most excellent metal. In brief, for I would fain have
made an end of this idle news, there was all the richness
in his Empire, in that all the beauty of his richness,
in them all ye desire of each eye: when he had saluted
ye judges he trotted twice or thrice about the lists, and
then lighted at his Pavilion which was there erected of
cloth of gold, where he sat with convenient company
and refreshed himself. Now in the mean the Turk
he set forward with an army double the Christian,
and 100,000 and above still left in the Camp. And
here I must needs leave to tell you of his exceeding
preparation unless I should make a whole volume,
for beside the wondrous furniture of his Soldiers, the
most rare choice of ornaments, there was nothing
could be devised, nay more than of set purpose could
be devised was there. But briefly I will turn to the
Turk himself, where if I had art according, I should
sooner weary you with delight than words: But

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 297]</span>

100,000 of his men having marched before to the banks
and there embattled themselves by the river all along,
with such hideous noise of Trumpets, horns (for so
they use), drums of brass, flutes, etc., that there was
more heard than seen by far, then approached the
great Turk himself, before him rode 4000 Janissaries
armed in their fashion, with a long Gown of Scarlet-red
laced with gold lace, and long sleeves of a very
narrow breadth, which was girt close unto him, under
that a good armour, with a long high cap like a milk-pail
for all the world, of white Satin or some such-like
gear, with a long feather enough to come down to
a tall man’s hams, very thick laced in the brims with
gold and pearl, in his hand a short Javelin, at his side
his Scimitar, at his back a great Quiver of broad arrows,
and by a string of silk hung his steel bow, over every
one hundred of these is a Boluch Bassa, a Centurion
as we call him, and these be of the Turk’s guard, and
are called Solaquis Archers, and they rode fifty in a
rank, then came following them about two hundred
Peicher or Peiclers, all in one livery of very rich tissue
after their fashion, and these are of the Turk’s Laqueis<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
which have a sharp teen<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Hatchet sticking at their
girdles, and the haft of Brasil,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> with this they will
stand thirty paces off and cleave a penny loaf or hit
it somewhere, they will commonly stick an inch and
half deep into a very tough Ashen wood, or a Brasil,
or such-like hard wood: there in great triumph
upon an Elephant richly trapped, stood a Tower of
two yards and a half high of pure silver, in the top
whereof stood an Image of beaten gold, representing

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span>

their Mahomet, round about which upon Mules
Azamoglans or Jamoglans, who are children of tribute
exacted upon the Christian captives, and contributary,
fine, sweet, and the most choice picked Gentlemen
brought up to sundry dainty qualities, who with
heavenly melody followed this Elephant, the religious
men going round about singing sweetly together:
afore all these next to the Janissaries went above
two hundred Trumpets, and as many followed the
great Turk, who then approached, having his Chariot
of pure silver of above 20,000 pound weight, drawn
with eight milk-white Elephants, round about rode
and went bare-headed, Azamoglans Peyclers most
gorgeously and resplendescent apparelled, under the
Turk’s feet lay a pillow of clear Crystal embossed at
the ends with huge golden knobs, on his head a wreath
of purple with a most rich diadem as it is commonly
known the order of it, the stage can shew the making
of it, but other things they differ mightily in. Here
you must suppose the exceeding glory of his apparel,
there he sat upright in the Chair with such a majestical,
proud, severe, war-like countenance, as justly became
so high a throne, before him went Aga which is the
great Captain of his Janissaries, with the Hali Bassa,
the Captain of his naval expeditions, Bianco Bassa,
the Captain of his Janissarie Harquebusiers, the
Zanfyretto Bassa Captain of his Guard, with others of
great authority bare-headed. After his Chariot came
sweet melody, and then five Elephants of War (an
Elephant is well-nigh as big as six Oxen gaunt and
slender like a horse in ye flanks, and of more swift
foot than a man would think for, his fashion is like

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 299]</span>

no beast in England, but the ridge of his back is like
that of an horse, his feet hath five great horny toes,
and a very long snout of above two yards in length,
with which he will draw by only snuffing up a good
pretty big lad, and deliver him to the Rider; this long
trunk falls down betwixt a large pair of teeth or tushes<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
of above an Ell and a half long (as ye may commonly
see at the Comb-makers in London) bending like a
Boar’s upward, his ears well-nigh from the top to
the nether tip of the hanging down above seven feet
long). And after these five Elephants, saddled and
ordered for a man to ride on, came trumpets, and all
in the like manner as before, and then marched 500
in a rank, 100,000 footmen, and by their sides for
wings 40,000 horsemen, so that he came to the combat
with 240,000 fighting-men, well accomplished in
arms: then was the great Turk carried under a goodly
canopy upon a black Waggon on men’s shoulders into
the Ferry, which was richly prepared, where in the
view of both Camps he landed, whilst the war-like
instruments echoed wide in the Air. In the Island for
Judges sat (in armour as did the others) the king of
Rhodes and the king of Pamphilia, now called Alcayr.
When the Turk was landed, there was brought to him
by the hands of two kings a great Elephant of an Ash
colour, white embossed very glitteringly, whereon
the great Turk mounted by a short ladder of silver,
armed very strongly and most beautifully, then took
he his Javelin in his hand and vibrated it in great
bravery (as he could handle his weapon well) and
hung his quiver of long Darts at his Back, then his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 300]</span>

Scimitar, etc., and so having saluted the Judges retired
unto the uttermost part of the field, then mounted up
the brave and puissant Emperor so lightly in his heavy
armour, as if either his gladness had lessened his
weight, or the goodness of his cause, to the great
rejoicing of the Christian and amazement of ye Turk,
at whom the Christians yelled so universally and
hallooed, and other infinite kinds of gladsome tokens,
that the Turk astonished stood stone still till the
Christian had done, and then as men new risen to life,
with such an horrible shout, that their voice rebounded
to the air, at which same time the Christian shouted
again with them, as if they would have committed
a battle with voices, and surely their voices did fight
in the wide coasts and shores of the air. This done
the Emperors prepared themselves to the fight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> when they were sworn that neither of them had
any magic herb, charm or incantation whereby they
might prevail in their fight on their adversary, and had
solemnized the accustomable ceremonies in like
matters of combat. The Heralds gave their words of
encounter, then with loud voice and shrill Trumpets’
courageous blast, whilst all the people were in dead
night expecting the demeanour of these renowned
Princes. Now we have brought you to behold these

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</span>

two champions, arrived thither with their brave
followers, ready to prove their valiance in the face of
so great a multitude. Now if you will stand aside
lest their ragged spears endamage you, I will give
you leave to look through the Lattice, where you shall
even now see the two Emperors, with their brave shock,
press Doubt betwixt their cruel encounterings. Now
you may see the two combatants, or but as yet champions,
coming from the ends of the field, the excellent
Christian Emperor with incomparable valour, visiting
his Horse sides with his spurs, carrying his spear in
the rest with an even level, so that the thundering of
the brave Steed presaged ye dint<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> of the great thunder-clap.
When Ali Chan, gently galloping with his huge
beast, came forward with more swift pace still as he
drew nearer to the Emperor. All this while you may
behold them hastening in their course, like as you see
two great waves galloping from the corners of the sea
driven by contrary winds, meeting together by long
random, to make the neighbours’ shores to quake and
dimmed with their boisterous career. The Emperor
being now with his greatest fury ready to fasten his
lance upon his adversary, and his adversary ready
to fasten his Javelin on him, when the Turk
suddenly stepped aside, and the Emperor thrusted
his void lance into the Air, (for he mought easily
do it), for though the Elephant be but low, yet
he was higher than his horse by a yard, and yet
his horse was the fairest and tallest to be found
in all Christendom, so that needs he must lay his spear
in an uneven height to break it on him. Suddenly ye

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 302]</span>

Turk stopped and with his nimble Beast followed the
Emperor as he had fled, whereat all the whole army of
Turks shouted horribly clapping their hands, and the
Christian stood still in great silence, struck with just
wonder of this strange Quiddity<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> in combat, and ere
the Emperor could make his stop with a short turn,
the Turk had hit him upon the shoulder with his
Javelin, which being denied entrance, for very anger
rent itself in forty pieces, and chid<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> in the Air till they
broke their necks on the ground: and had not then
the Horse started, the monstrous Elephant had over-thrown
him with his rider to the earth. But then the
Horse incensed with ire for this injury, and his master
more hotly burning with disdain and furious gall,
leaped, bounded, and sent out at his mouth the foamy
arguments of his better<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> stomach, but so fast the vile
Turk followed, that he had spent three long Darts
upon the barbed flanks of the Horse, which all in
vain returned to their Master. The beholding Turks
so eagerly pursuing the strokes with shouting, as if
with a hidden Sympathy their training<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> had augmented
the violence of the blows. At length the good Emperor
sorely ashamed came now to make him amends for
his pretty falsery: and with great scope thronging<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
his lance forward just upward upon the Turk’s face,
and when he was almost by him, the Infidel, as if he
but make a sport of the fight, stepped aside very
delivery,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> thinking that he should have made him
run in the like order as before, but he, more

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 303]</span>

cautelous marking of purpose which way he meant
to decline, turned with him, and his learned Horse
could well do it, and indeed desire of revenge
had so seated itself in his brave courageous breast,
that now he even followed him as he had been drawn
with Cart-ropes, the Turk seeing how he was circumvented,
fetched a pretty compass and trod a round,
the Elephant flying from ye horse and the horse following
the Elephant, as you might see Seignior Prospero
lead the way in Mile end Green in the ringles,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> this
was a pretty sport to see the matter turned to a play.
Now the Christians having like occasion to shew their
gladness, gave such an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Applaudite</i> as never was heard
in any Theatre, laughing so effusedly that they dashed
their adversaries clean out of countenance, tickling
again with the long loud laughter: When they had
run not passing twice about, the Turk, seeing his
time, conveyed himself out of the ring, and then got
again on his back, spending his cowardly Darts upon
his strong enemy’s armour, and so fast he followed
and so quickly the good Emperor turned back again,
that his horse’s barb of Steel out-sticking in his front,
met just upon the outside of the right eye of the Elephant,
that it sticking out a foot entered in above an
inch, which ye horse perceiving made the rest follow
into his head up to the hilts (as to say) laying out his
fore feet out straight, and his hinder legs in like manner,
went poking, and crowded himself forward still gathering
upon the Elephant, so that not so much with the
Horse’s force as the great beast’s cruel pain, the
Elephant swayed back above one hundred feet. Now

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 304]</span>

was the Emperor glad, and with both his hands lifting
himself upon his stirrups, took his lance and struck
with the point the Turk full on the vizard so thick
and so many times, that some blood followed, with an
hue and cry out of the windows of the Helmet, to find
the worker of his effusion: till the villian slave
drawing his fine sword smote the lance very bravely
in two, and casting his shield afore him, received the
last stroke on the truncheon of it, which the gentle
Emperor with fell fury threw at him, that he made him
decline almost to the fall. The Turk sitting on the
Elephant’s back could not with his Scimitar reach the
Christian, nor he the Turk with his Curtilax,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> so that
now they sat and looked one upon the other, and the
people at them, and all at this strange coping.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The
good Horse Grauntier by chance being gored a little
under the mane betwixt the bendings of the barbs
with the sharp tusk of the Elephant, neighed with
great stomach, and leasing<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> from the beast which he
had well-nigh forced to the lists’ end, being thereto
forwarded with the sharp spurs with so exceeding
fury, that it was not only a marvel how the good Prince
could sit him so assuredly, and also that he spoiled
not himself, and with more eager fury began to gallop
upon the Elephant again, his mouth wide open, and
horrible with the salt fume<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> which in abundance
issued from his great heart: for by how much the
more a thing is gentle and quiet, by so much the more
being moved he is iracund<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and implacable. But the
Emperor turning his reins carried him clean contrary<span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span>
to the lists’ end, where stood lances for the same purpose
as the manner is, of which he chose the two stiffest,
longest, and rudest for their stature and came softly
pacing to the Turk: who stood even there still where
he was, the Elephant bleeding in such abundance, that
by the loss of so much blood his meekness turned into
rage, and began to rise and bray, and stamp, and with
an uncertain sway to move, so that with much ado
the Slave stayed and appeased him, then the brave
Emperor, lifting up his vizor not only to take breath
but the more freely that his speech might have passage,
he told the Turk that he had in a base cowardly manner
by false fraud and unequal fight dishonoured himself
and endangered him, for which he told him <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Malgrado
suo</i><a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> he would be gloriously revenged: and now that
they had spent a good time in uncertain Fortune, he
had brought two lances, choose which he would, and
either begin the fight anew or make an end of the old,
promising upon his Honour that if he refused so to do,
he would fasten one in his beast and another in his
heart. And if he dared to do that, he bade him come
down on foot and there break a staff with him. The
Turk, as he was an Honourable soldier, then presently
slipped off his Elephant, bravely answering that he
came to conquer him in sport, and not meaning to
make a purposed battle, but sith he was so presumptuous
as to dare him to his face, he should soon perceive
how lightly he weighed his proud words, and then
skipping to him straight a Lance out of his hand, and
went one hundred paces backwards, so did the Emperor
very joyfully, when they were come so far as they

thought, they might trust to their breath, holding their
Lances in both their hands, began to run very swiftly,
and desire brought them together so fast and outrageously,
that their Lances somewhat too malapert<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
not suffering them to come together, hurled the Turk
above seven feet of the Lances’ length, so that not one
there but thought he had been either slain, or his wind
dashed out of his belly: the Prince reeled backward
above two paces and yet fell down much astonished.
The people on both sides exceedingly amazed and
affrighted, especially the Turks, who sent out such
a doleful <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sauntus</i><a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> that it would have moved the stones
to ruth, but the dolour of the Christian was not so great,
for the moving of the Emperor revived their spirits
much. In a cause on which the beholders’ safeties
do depend, the ill-success is much feared, for it may
be seen by this, that they will with a certain alacrity
and Sympathy seem to help or pity as the cause
requires. On a sudden the Emperor lifted up his head,
at which the Christians gave such an universal shout,
as if even now they would have frayed<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> the mountains
adjacent. The two courageous beasts having lately
heaped up red-hot rancour in their disdainful stomachs,
assaulted the one the other with all the weapons of
nature, that it had been enough for to have delighted
anyone, but the Horse had some small advantage
by reason of the Elephant’s right eye was covered with
the trailing down of the blood. By this time the
Emperors rose again, and the one went to his Horse,
the other to his Elephant, having first splintered their

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 307]</span>

spears, and fenced so long as any virtue remained in
the slaughtered Lances. When each had gotten to
their beasts, they began to forward them, who with
equal ire moved needed no encouragement, then did
the Emperor coming with full scope upon the Turk,
smite the Elephant just upon one of the teeth, while
with great rage the Horse had fastened his pike again
in the Jaw bone, so that the Elephant still swayed
back, but neither of them being able to reach the one
the other, the excellent Prince, casting his golden shield
before him and drawing his glittering Curtelax, leaped
upon the neck of his Horse, and laying one hand upon
the one tooth of the Elephant, with the other hand
upon the thong, that went across his forehead, vaulted
up, and settling his feet upon the tusks and his hand
on the head of the beast, cast up himself, and laid his
sitting place where his hands were, and there rode by
little and a little till he might buckle with the insedent.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
No sooner came he within the reach of the Turk, but
he smote the Turk so freely, who was ready prepared
for him, that he made him decline a little, there they
fought so long that the Elephant driven through pain
was thrust up to the lists, hereupon all the people
Christian in a more free manner than ever at any time
before, all the while their hard-metalled swords played
upon each other’s shield, so that the glory of their
rare fight was so wonderfully pleasing to the eye, and
so honourable to the combatants, that if they had
jested, one would well have been contented to view all
the long day: but the good Prince was too hard for

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 308]</span>

the other, for with his ready blows he urged the great
Slave out of his cell, and made him sit behind the
arson<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> of the saddle, and if this chance had not happened,
he had surely made him sit behind the arson
of his Elephant’s Tail. For as soon as the Elephant
had but touched the lists, the Christian Marshals of
the field came galloping and parted the Combatants,
holding the Turk as vanquished, whilst betwixt the
contrary and adverse part there was four Negatives,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
so that well-nigh they had fallen to blows, for ye case
seemed to the Christian plain, to the Turk unjust.
That because the Beast whereon he rode went to the
Lists’ end, therefore the stopper should be blamed.
Well, Heralds whose office it is to deal in such royal
matters, had the discussing of it, and it was deferred
to arbiters, with this condition, that if the Turk was
found vanquished, he should be yielded as recreant
(and miscreant he was). So the matter was posted off
whilst it never was concluded, and both the parties
departed, the one to ye camp, the other to the city,
in no less solemn pomp than they entered accompanied
into the sands, where so rare a chance fortuned
betwixt so puissaunt Emperors. And because the
matter was as strange as true, I have sojourned a little
too long in it. But in the next Inn you shall have a
better refreshment or a newer choice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> chance a Knight smote Faustus a box on the ear
in the presence of a great company of brave Ladies,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 309]</span>

wherefore he swore to be egregiously revenged on
him, giving him the Field, which the Knight refused
not, so the weapons, the place, the time were ordained,
and Faustus went out to the field, and no sooner was
Faustus gone out of the presence but Signior di
Medesimo, who was well-known to be a valorous and
courageous man in his kind as any was about the
Court, on a sudden fell down on his knees before all
the Ladies, shaking and quivering, with a face as pale
as him which was new risen from a month’s burying,
desiring them if ever they tendered any Gentleman’s
case, to entreat Monsieur Infeligo to forgive him his
trespass. At this the whole assembly burst out into
a loud laughter, to see the man that was even now in
his brave terms and vaunting words to come in all
submissive manner to entreat for a pardon so ridiculously.
He yet not desisting with many a salt tear and
hands lifted up towards the Heavens, from whence his
pity came, when Faustus came blowing in like a swashbuckler
with his Rapier by his side and his hand on
his Poynard, swearing all the cross row over.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> But
when he saw the Knight in such a pickle, he sat himself
against a wall and laughed so loud and so heartily,
that all the whole rout could not choose but laugh
with him, and here was laughing, and here and there
and everywhere. At length two Ladies rose, to whom
perhaps this Knight owed some particular service,
and desired Don Infeligo with very mild sermon to be
friends with Medesimo again, he told them that they
could not demand the thing which he would not
readily fulfil, marry he requested this, that as the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 310]</span>

disgrace which he had received was too great to be
forgotten without some such equal revenge, that he
might use some like injury, whereby he might be satisfied
and he might again come into his grace: which
they granted. Faustus came to Medesimo and reared
him up upon his feet, and then got upon his back,
and so rid twice about the Chamber, and when he
had done he took him by the chin, who had not yet
forgotten how to weep, shaking worse then any school-boy
when he fears to climb the horse, and gave him
a good box on the ear and went his way. So the Knight
was utterly disgraced, and for shame durst not be
seen all that day after. They which were there had
sport abundance, and Faustus was feared for his
brave valour and with his continual delight in knavery
got him foes enough too.</p>

she commanded him to do, he would do it, if she would
grant him grace. The Gentlewoman belike willing
to hear him speak so not to her, required him to build
in that place with one word a Castle of fine silver, at
which the Gentleman amazed went away confounded,
Faustus followed him fast, and said to him that he had
overheard the Lady’s unjust demand, wherefore go
say (quoth he) thou wilt do it with one word. And so
the Gentleman did and it was done, whilst he ran
laughing in to many nobles and lusty gallants, telling

them he would shew them the strangest thing that
ever they saw, and all they came running into the
garden together, where they found the Gentleman fast

wrench in his arms. O Lord, what wondrous sport did
he make them there. And when they had laughed

the street, and walking there by chance espied four
Gentlewomen seeming to be sisters, them they cast
to abuse, and they were never content to play any
merry pranks for honest sport, but they must be so
satirically full of gall, that they commonly proved
infamous, sparing neither their good name on whom
they committed them nor any kind of villainy, so it
might procure mirth: when they had talked sufficiently
with them, they did so much that they were contented
to ride abroad with them, and so each fetched his horse
and came to them masked, and the Gentlewomen were
wimpled likewise (for the men as well as women use
there to wear masks). Thus they rode to the common
furlong where many Italian gentlemen were playing
at the Balloon, and there they rode round about,
whole armies of shouts accompanying them, they riding

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 312]</span>

still backward and forward, whilst these men-women
had sewed their coats to their doublets, and pinned
upon their backs things of vile reproach amongst
them, then rode they to the Court not yet satisfied,
where they were entertained with more merriment
and laughter. And when these men-women saw the
greatest multitude that was there likely to be, even
upon a piece of ground which was higher than all the
rest, they leaped down, and by reason of the friendship
betwixt their petticoats and their doublets, they haled
them all down one after another, the horses ran away,
and they lay upon them to their great confusion and
reproach, yet they thought all well sith they were
personated and masked, but the women stripped off
their women’s garments and their head attires, and
there they were well known to be four brave noble
young Gentlemen brethren, and each of them rent off
the masks of Mephostophiles and his mates, and detected
them to their great shame, who neither durst
revenge themselves for fear of further displeasure, nor of
revealing what they were, nor could be moaned of any
one for their notable abuses aforehand, so that whereas
in others it had been but a common jest, on them it
was wonderful strange and ridiculous. So they with
shame enough went fretting in vain to their lodging.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Emperor being some five or six days in rest within
his walls, caused, as sloth cannot dwell in true noble
breasts, the whole Army to set forward, leaving a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 313]</span>

convenient Garrison within the City of 30,000 men,
marched into the fields in sundry embattles with above
130,000 men. And there in the view of the Army
Mephostophiles, Akercocke, Wagner, Faustus pricked
up to the Turk’s camp, armed in complete harness,
and there challenged any four to break a staff with
them, then came there forth four Janissaries horsemen
armed at all assays,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and there they ran together to
the singular delight of the beholders, so gallantly they
demeaned themselves, but in the cope<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> all the four
Janissaries were run quite through and through (as
they say) and there lay on the cold earth, then made
these four fellows in Arms their stop and expected a
fresh revenge: which came immediately thundering out
of the entry of the Camp, with whom to occur in time
they met with the like success as before, to their singular
commendations and high praises: then gan the Turk
to stamp and fret, and commanded four of the best
in his whole camp, and four more with them to run at
these villains and to captive them, where they should
rue the rashness of their presumption with long
eternal torment. These eight came with all their power
together and broke their lances very hardly upon their
faces, and so did they four on theirs, then they drew
their swords committing a brave tourney, till two of
the Turks were slain, and the six fled, which were
immediately hanged, at which ye Christian laughed
heartily, and these four returned thanked highly, and
for that the Enemy would not advance himself to the

<h3 id="SR_CHAP_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> two a clock in the night the Turk approached
with all his whole army unto the walls of the City,
causing particular bands and Pioneers to dig through
the countermure, the Sentinels which were on the
walls, privily espying by reason the Moon gave some
slender light, though she was but three days old,
gave warning without any alarm to the chief commanders:
so that the whole power of the City almost
was gathered into Arms, without any stroke of the
Drum. The place wherein the Turk was entering,
was right against a street’s end of above two yards
over and not above thirty yards from the breach, they
had digged a deep trench and placed on the scarf nine
double cannons thoroughly round and charged with
chain and murdering shot, and on each side of the
cross street they had erected forts of gravel, etc., like
our Barricadoes now, in each of which they placed
above fifteen Culverin and Cannon. Now the breach
being sufficient, the Turk having entered above 2,000
men, gave ye onset, and sounded the bloody alarm,
when suddenly the Flankers discharged and the
bulwarks shot freely together, and utterly cut off all
them that entered beyond the ditch, and betwixt those
three mentioned Forts with their terrible shot, they
swept them all out of the place, then began the Turk
to thrust his men forward upon the breach (having
lost in this assault above 2,100) and ever as they came
up to the breach, the Cannon heaved them off, and the
small shot from the loops so galled them that they

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span>

durst not approach. But the Turk cared not, for the
murthering of his men might weary the Cannons’
insatiate cruelty at length. Then was the alarm given
through the City, and everyone fell to their Arms,
getting to the walls, and the rest to the assembling
places, whilst the Turk freshly filled the breaches
with murthered men, he enforcing himself to his power
to enter, and they to keep him out. When he saw
that how he had stopped the breaches so with dead
bodies, which almost made a new red sea with their
blood, in a great rage transporting above 30,000 men
over the Danuby, furnished them with scaling ladders,
whilst he with great store of cannon beat his own slain
men off the fore-named breaches, for he was a merciless
tyrant, and caused them to assault the wall itself,
which they did. Now began the morning to appear,
and ye Christian came just upon the backs of the assailants,
with the greatest part of the whole power of
the city, and put them all to the sword, save those
that escaped from them by water, but killed of their
own fellows. Then the Christian marched upon the
Turk, who seeing his power greatly weakened, having
lost at his unlucky assault above 23,000 men, cursing
and banning his disastrous fortune, and his Gods the
givers of it, retired in a flying pace to his camp, whilst
the plenteous spoil made rich the Christian, for upon
the dead carcases were found store of jewels and gold
in great plenty.</p>
<hr class="chap">

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<h3 id="SR_CHAP_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> new victory gladded the Christians exceedingly,
as much as it grieved the Turk. The breaches now
were freshly repaired with all expedition. The
Christian princes seeing the inconvenience that
followed their keeping within the City, and how great
shame it were for them to abstain from the enemy,
considering their power to be not much inferior to
that of the Turks in number, much more in brave
soldiery, wherefore they made a general muster, and
determined to offer the battle to them in the plain
field, which if they refused, they would give them in
their camps, concluding all under one day’s valiance,
then marched forth the English archers, of whom
Wagner desired he might be with his fellows, which
when they had taken their stand, they brought store
of fletchery<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> to them in carts, which were there disburdened,
so every archer being five double furnished,
the number of them now was nine thousand, the pike
being converted into them, being thereto desirous, and
having therefore made great suit, for the Emperor was
very loth to forget their first good service: Faustus counselled
the Captain to choose a plot of above one hundred
acres square, where it was open to each horseman,
which they marvelled at greatly, but yet they easily
granted to stand anywhere: they were so well placed,
that they stood as well to defend the friend, as to offend
the foe. Then in due order marched out the whole

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 317]</span>

armies of the Christian, and so settled themselves,
whilst the Turk brought forward his thick swarms.
Now it had been a brave sight, to see the greatest
princes of the whole world East and West, attended
on by their whole forces set in array, their gorgeous
and bright armours and weapons casting up long
trammels of golden shine to the heavens, the noise
of clarions, trumpets, etc., encouraging the fainting
soldier, and increasing the boldness of the resolute.
There was at once in this Field all the terror of the
world, accompanied with all the beauty. In the City
you might have seen the remainders at the churches
at prayer, solemn procession round about the town
with great devotion, etc. Well, the time was come
that the horsemen began to assault the pike, and
attempting the ruptures of their array, and the forlorn
hopes fiercely skirmishing, whilst with loud outcries
the whole use of hearing was taken away: above you
nothing but smoke, round about you the thundering
cannon, and sharp horrors of sundry weapons, and at
your feet death. There might you see the great use
of the eughen<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> bow, for the horse no whit fearing the
musket, or culiver,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> as used to it, nor yet respects the
piercing of a bullet, by the thick tempest of arrows,
hiding their eyes, and hurting their bodies, overthrew
the horsemaster to the ground, on that side could not
one horseman appear, but straight they fetched him
down, so that of thirty thousand horsemen of one
assault, there was not one that came within five
spears’ length of the battle on foot. The great Turk
cursing heaven and earth, and all trees that bore such

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 318]</span>

murthering fruit as bows and arrows, caused a troop
of five hundred barbed horses, with twenty thousand
more to run upon the archers altogether, which they
did, but when they came just upon a little ridge,
not one horse but suddenly stopped, and the riders
which now had rested their staves, lying close upon
the saddle pommels, were thrown quite out of the
saddle, and either their backs broken, or quite slain.
All the whole archery with the camp wondering hereat,
as ignorant of the matter, everyone suspending his
several judgment, but Faustus laughed heartily, who
knew the matter plain, for there had they buried in
sand all the way wolves’ guts, which by natural magic,
as authors affirm, suffers not the horse to come over
it in any case, nor any force can carry him over with
a rider on him. For the Archers drew just upon, and
so universally shot together, that all the troops were
put to flight, and above half spoiled and murthered.
To be brief, so much the Christian prevailed upon
the Turk in three hours and a half fight, that all them
were turned and fled, each one advancing forward in
his flight, there were slain in this battle and flight
above seven score thousand Turks, the great Turk
himself fighting manfully on his Elephant, was by
the Emperor’s own hands slain, all his chief Bassas
and men of honour, to the number of three hundred
died manfully about him: now the retreat was sounded,
and they marched home in most glorious pomp and
rejoicing, where the soldiers made rich with the great
spoil of the camp, were dismissed, and the princes
returned home, and due order taken for the safety of
the City. So the Duke of Austria rid of his enemies,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 319]</span>

gave himself to his forepassed life, and the other
princes with great joy caused general feasts and triumphs
to be performed in all their kingdoms, provinces, and
territories whatsoever.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
